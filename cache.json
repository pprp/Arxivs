However, scaling the\ngeneration inference of LLMs to such long contexts incurs significant\nadditional computation load, and demands a substantial GPU memory footprint to\nmaintain the key-value (KV) cache of transformer-based LLMs. Existing KV cache\ncompression methods, such as quantization, face memory bottlenecks as context\nlength increases, while static-sized caches, such as eviction, suffer from\ninefficient policies. These limitations restrict deployment on consumer-grade\ndevices like a single Nvidia 4090 GPU. To overcome this, we propose Locret, a\nframework for long-context LLM inference that introduces retaining heads to\nevaluate the causal importance of KV cache units, allowing for more accurate\neviction within a fixed cache size. Locret is fine-tuned on top of the frozen\nbackbone LLM using a minimal amount of data from standard long-context SFT\ndatasets. During inference, we evict low-importance cache units along with a\nchunked prefill pattern, significantly reducing peak GPU memory usage. We\nconduct an extensive empirical study to evaluate Locret, where the experimental\nresults show that Locret outperforms the recent competitive approaches,\nincluding InfLLM, Quantization, SirLLM, and MInference, in terms of memory\nefficiency and the quality of generated contents -- Locret achieves over a 20x\nand 8x KV cache compression ratio compared to the full KV cache for\nPhi-3-mini-128K and Llama-3.1-8B-instruct. Additionally, Locret can be combined\nwith other methods, such as quantization and token merging. To our knowledge,\nLocret is the first framework capable of deploying Llama-3.1-8B or similar\nmodels on a single Nvidia 4090 GPU, enabling 128K long-context inference\nwithout compromising generation quality, and requiring little additional system\noptimizations.\n","authors":["Yuxiang Huang","Binhang Yuan","Xu Han","Chaojun Xiao","Zhiyuan Liu"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.01805v1.pdf","comment":"Preprints"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01795v1","updated":"2024-10-02T17:53:08Z","published":"2024-10-02T17:53:08Z","title":"Knowledge-Driven Feature Selection and Engineering for Genotype Data\n  with Large Language Models","summary":"  Predicting phenotypes with complex genetic bases based on a small,\ninterpretable set of variant features remains a challenging task.\nConventionally, data-driven approaches are utilized for this task, yet the high\ndimensional nature of genotype data makes the analysis and prediction\ndifficult.

The new algorithm\ncosts significantly less computation resource than 8-bit floating point\nmultiplication but achieves higher precision. Compared to 8-bit floating point\nmultiplications, the proposed method achieves higher precision but consumes\nsignificantly less bit-level computation. Since multiplying floating point\nnumbers requires substantially higher energy compared to integer addition\noperations, applying the L-Mul operation in tensor processing hardware can\npotentially reduce 95% energy cost by element-wise floating point tensor\nmultiplications and 80% energy cost of dot products.

This paper\nargues that integrating length extension with a GPU-friendly KV cache reduction\narchitecture not only reduces training overhead during length extension, but\nalso achieves better long-context performance. This leads to our proposed\nLongGen, which finetunes a pretrained LLM into an efficient architecture during\nlength extension. LongGen builds on three key insights: (1) Sparse attention\npatterns, such as window attention (attending to recent tokens), attention sink\n(initial ones), and blockwise sparse attention (strided token blocks) are\nwell-suited for building efficient long-context models, primarily due to their\nGPU-friendly memory access patterns, enabling efficiency gains not just\ntheoretically but in practice as well. (2) It is essential for the model to\nhave direct access to all tokens. A hybrid architecture with 1/3 full attention\nlayers and 2/3 efficient ones achieves a balanced trade-off between efficiency\nand long-context performance.

Current systems for spoken dialogue rely on pipelines of\nindependent components, namely voice activity detection, speech recognition,\ntextual dialogue and text-to-speech. Such frameworks cannot emulate the\nexperience of real conversations. First, their complexity induces a latency of\nseveral seconds between interactions. Second, text being the intermediate\nmodality for dialogue, non-linguistic information that modifies meaning -- such\nas emotion or non-speech sounds -- is lost in the interaction. Finally, they\nrely on a segmentation into speaker turns, which does not take into account\noverlapping speech, interruptions and interjections. Moshi solves these\nindependent issues altogether by casting spoken dialogue as speech-to-speech\ngeneration. Starting from a text language model backbone, Moshi generates\nspeech as tokens from the residual quantizer of a neural audio codec, while\nmodeling separately its own speech and that of the user into parallel streams.\nThis allows for the removal of explicit speaker turns, and the modeling of\narbitrary conversational dynamics. We moreover extend the hierarchical\nsemantic-to-acoustic token generation of previous work to first predict\ntime-aligned text tokens as a prefix to audio tokens.

By\nintroducing a probabilistic convergence criterion, our SJD accelerates the\ninference of auto-regressive text-to-image generation while maintaining the\nrandomness in sampling-based token decoding and allowing the model to generate\ndiverse images. Specifically, SJD facilitates the model to predict multiple\ntokens at each step and accepts tokens based on the probabilistic criterion,\nenabling the model to generate images with fewer steps than the conventional\nnext-token-prediction paradigm. We also investigate the token initialization\nstrategies that leverage the spatial locality of visual data to further improve\nthe acceleration ratio under specific scenarios. We conduct experiments for our\nproposed SJD on multiple auto-regressive text-to-image generation models,\nshowing the effectiveness of model acceleration without sacrificing the visual\nquality.\n","authors":["Yao Teng","Han Shi","Xian Liu","Xuefei Ning","Guohao Dai","Yu Wang","Zhenguo Li","Xihui Liu"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.01699v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01698v1","updated":"2024-10-02T16:05:15Z","published":"2024-10-02T16:05:15Z","title":"COSMIC: Compress Satellite Images Efficiently via Diffusion Compensation","summary":"  With the rapidly increasing number of satellites in space and their enhanced\ncapabilities, the amount of earth observation images collected by satellites is\nexceeding the transmission limits of satellite-to-ground links.

However, NeRF faces inherent\nlimitations: (i) limited representational capacity for 3DOD due to its implicit\nnature, and (ii) slow rendering speeds. Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)\nhas emerged as an explicit 3D representation that addresses these limitations.\nInspired by these advantages, this paper introduces 3DGS into 3DOD for the\nfirst time, identifying two main challenges: (i) Ambiguous spatial distribution\nof Gaussian blobs: 3DGS primarily relies on 2D pixel-level supervision,\nresulting in unclear 3D spatial distribution of Gaussian blobs and poor\ndifferentiation between objects and background, which hinders 3DOD; (ii)\nExcessive background blobs: 2D images often include numerous background pixels,\nleading to densely reconstructed 3DGS with many noisy Gaussian blobs\nrepresenting the background, negatively affecting detection.

While large vision language\nrepresentations like CLIP had largely resolved the task of zero-shot object\nrecognition, zero-shot visual attribute recognition remains a challenge because\nCLIP's contrastively-learned vision-language representation cannot effectively\ncapture object-attribute dependencies. In this paper, we target this weakness\nand propose a sentence generation-based retrieval formulation for attribute\nrecognition that is novel in 1) explicitly modeling a to-be-measured and\nretrieved object-attribute relation as a conditional probability graph, which\nconverts the recognition problem into a dependency-sensitive language-modeling\nproblem, and 2) applying a large pretrained Vision-Language Model (VLM) on this\nreformulation and naturally distilling its knowledge of image-object-attribute\nrelations to use towards attribute recognition. Specifically, for each\nattribute to be recognized on an image, we measure the visual-conditioned\nprobability of generating a short sentence encoding the attribute's relation to\nobjects on the image. Unlike contrastive retrieval, which measures likelihood\nby globally aligning elements of the sentence to the image, generative\nretrieval is sensitive to the order and dependency of objects and attributes in\nthe sentence.

Furthermore, those metrics enable tasks such as image retrieval,\nobject recognition and quality assessment, essential in fields like healthcare,\nastronomy and surveillance. Existing metrics, such as PSNR, MSE, SSIM, ISSM and\nFSIM, often face limitations in terms of either speed, complexity or\nsensitivity to small changes in images. To address these challenges, a novel\nimage similarity metric, namely CSIM, that combines real-time while being\nsensitive to subtle image variations is investigated in this paper. The novel\nmetric uses Gaussian Copula from probability theory to transform an image into\nvectors of pixel distribution associated to local image patches. These vectors\ncontain, in addition to intensities and pixel positions, information on the\ndependencies between pixel values, capturing the structural relationships\nwithin the image. By leveraging the properties of Copulas, CSIM effectively\nmodels the joint distribution of pixel intensities, enabling a more nuanced\ncomparison of image patches making it more sensitive to local changes compared\nto other metrics. Experimental results demonstrate that CSIM outperforms\nexisting similarity metrics in various image distortion scenarios, including\nnoise, compression artifacts and blur. The metric's ability to detect subtle\ndifferences makes it suitable for applications requiring high precision, such\nas medical imaging, where the detection of minor anomalies can be of a high\nimportance.

For this\npurpose, our prototype camera uses a coded aperture with 1k rectangular shape\npinholes in a thin metal plate, such as copper, which hinder the growth of\nbiofouling and keep the surface clean. Although images taken by lens-less\ncameras are usually not well formed due to lack of the traditional glass-based\nlens, a deep learning approach using ViT (Vision Transformer) has recently\ndemonstrated reconstructing original photo images well and our study shows that\nusing gated MLP (Multilayer Perceptron) also yields good results. On the other\nhand, a certain degree of thickness for bio-repellence materials is required to\nexhibit their effect the thickness of aperture is necessary to use apertures\nsufficiently thinner than the size of the pinholes to avoid unintentional\nreflection and absorption on the sidewalls.

A unified representation across various\nmodalities is particularly important for improving efficiency and performance.\nRecent binding methods, such as ImageBind (Girdhar et al., 2023), typically use\na fixed anchor modality to align multimodal data in the anchor modal embedding\nspace. In this paper, we mathematically analyze the fixed anchor binding\nmethods and uncover notable limitations: (1) over-reliance on the choice of the\nanchor modality, (2) failure to capture intra-modal information, and (3)\nfailure to account for inter-modal correlation among non-anchored modalities.\nTo address these limitations, we propose CentroBind, a simple yet powerful\napproach that eliminates the need for a fixed anchor; instead, it employs\ndynamically adjustable centroid-based anchors generated from all available\nmodalities, resulting in a balanced and rich representation space. We\ntheoretically demonstrate that our method captures three crucial properties of\nmultimodal learning: intra-modal learning, inter-modal learning, and multimodal\nalignment, while also constructing a robust unified representation across all\nmodalities.

However, recent studies have identified\nthat the information loss in the CLIP encoding process is substantial, and CLIP\ntends to capture only coarse-grained features from the input. This deficiency\nsignificantly limits the ability of a single CLIP model to handle images rich\nin visual detail. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective\nmodel-agnostic strategy, Diversified Multiplet Upcycling (DMU), for CLIP. DMU\nefficiently fine-tunes a series of CLIP models that capture different feature\nspaces, from a dense pre-trained CLIP checkpoint, sharing parameters except for\nthe Feed-Forward Network (FFN). These models can then be transformed into a\nCLIP-MoE with a larger model capacity, leading to significantly enhanced\nperformance with minimal computational overhead. To the best of our knowledge,\nDiversified Multiplet Upcycling is the first approach to introduce sparsely\nactivated MoE into CLIP foundation models. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthe significant performance of CLIP-MoE across various zero-shot retrieval,\nzero-shot image classification tasks, and downstream Multimodal Large Language\nModel (MLLM) benchmarks by serving as a vision encoder. Furthermore,\nDiversified Multiplet Upcycling enables the conversion of any dense CLIP model\ninto CLIP-MoEs, which can seamlessly replace CLIP in a plug-and-play manner\nwithout requiring further adaptation in downstream frameworks.

However, even state-of-the-art\nvision-language models (VLMs), such as GPT-4o, still fall short of human-level\nperformance, particularly in intricate web environments and long-horizon\nplanning tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce Reflective Monte\nCarlo Tree Search (R-MCTS), a novel test-time algorithm designed to enhance the\nability of AI agents, e.g., powered by GPT-4o, to explore decision space on the\nfly. R-MCTS extends traditional MCTS by 1) incorporating contrastive\nreflection, allowing agents to learn from past interactions and dynamically\nimprove their search efficiency; and 2) using multi-agent debate to provide\nreliable state evaluation. Moreover, we improve the agent's performance by\nfine-tuning GPT-4o through self-learning, using R-MCTS generated tree\ntraversals without any human-provided labels. On the challenging VisualWebArena\nbenchmark, our GPT-4o-based R-MCTS agent achieves a 6% to 30% relative\nimprovement across various tasks compared to the previous state-of-the-art.\nAdditionally, we show that the knowledge gained from test-time search can be\neffectively transferred back to GPT-4o via fine-tuning. The fine-tuned GPT-4o\nmatches 97% of R-MCTS's performance while reducing compute usage by a factor of\nfour at test time. Furthermore, qualitative results reveal that the fine-tuned\nGPT-4o model demonstrates the ability to explore the environment, evaluate a\nstate, and backtrack to viable ones when it detects that the current state\ncannot lead to success.

In this paper, we introduce a novel method called late\nchunking, which leverages long context embedding models to first embed all\ntokens of the long text, with chunking applied after the transformer model and\njust before mean pooling - hence the term late in its naming. The resulting\nchunk embeddings capture the full contextual information, leading to superior\nresults across various retrieval tasks.

Previous methods either rely on\ndecomposing weight matrices (e.g., LoRA), or seek to decompose gradient\nmatrices (e.g., GaLore) to ensure reduced memory consumption. However, both of\nthem constrain the training in a low-rank subspace, thus inevitably leading to\nsub-optimal performance. This raises a question: whether it is possible to\nconsistently preserve the low-rank constraint for memory efficiency, while\nachieving full-rank training (i.e., training with full-rank gradients of\nfull-rank weights) to avoid inferior outcomes? In this paper, we propose a new\nplug-and-play training framework for LLMs called Fira, as the first attempt to\nachieve this goal. First, we observe an interesting phenomenon during LLM\ntraining: the scaling impact of adaptive optimizers (e.g., Adam) on the\ngradient norm remains similar from low-rank to full-rank training. Based on\nthis observation, we propose a norm-based scaling method, which utilizes the\nscaling impact of low-rank optimizers as substitutes for that of original\nfull-rank optimizers to enable full-rank training. In this way, we can preserve\nthe low-rank constraint in the optimizer while achieving full-rank training for\nbetter performance. Moreover, we find that there are sudden gradient rises\nduring the optimization process, potentially causing loss spikes. To address\nthis, we further put forward a norm-growth limiter to smooth the gradient via\nregulating the relative increase of gradient norms. Extensive experiments on\nthe pre-training and fine-tuning of LLMs show that Fira outperforms both LoRA\nand GaLore, achieving performance that is comparable to or even better than\nfull-rank training.\n","authors":["Xi Chen","Kaituo Feng","Changsheng Li","Xunhao Lai","Xiangyu Yue","Ye Yuan","Guoren Wang"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.01623v1.pdf","comment":"Code is available at: https://github.com/xichen-fy/Fira"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14953v3","updated":"2024-10-02T14:56:33Z","published":"2024-05-23T18:01:11Z","title":"MallowsPO: Fine-Tune Your LLM with Preference Dispersions","summary":"  Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has recently emerged as a popular\napproach to improve reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF), leading\nto better techniques to fine-tune large language models (LLM).

In contrast\nto traditional kernel SGD, T-kernel SGD is more effective in balancing bias and\nvariance by dynamically adjusting the hypothesis space during iterations. The\nmost significant advantage of the proposed algorithm is that it can achieve\ntheoretically optimal convergence rates using a constant step size (independent\nof the sample size) while overcoming the inherent saturation problem of kernel\nSGD. Additionally, we leverage the structure of spherical polynomials to derive\nan equivalent T-kernel SGD, significantly reducing storage and computational\ncosts compared to kernel SGD. Typically, T-kernel SGD requires only\n$\\mathcal{O}(n^{1+\\frac{d}{d-1}\\epsilon})$ computational complexity and\n$\\mathcal{O}(n^{\\frac{d}{d-1}\\epsilon})$ storage to achieve optimal rates for\nthe d-dimensional sphere, where $0<\\epsilon<\\frac{1}{2}$ can be arbitrarily\nsmall if the optimal fitting or the underlying space possesses sufficient\nregularity.

Those labelled training data provide crucial prior\nknowledge about abnormalities for GAD models, enabling substantially reduced\ndetection errors. However, current supervised GAD methods tend to\nover-emphasise fitting the seen anomalies, leading to many errors of detecting\nthe unseen anomalies as normal nodes. Further, existing open-set AD models were\nintroduced to handle Euclidean data, failing to effectively capture\ndiscriminative features from graph structure and node attributes for GAD. In\nthis work, we propose a novel open-set GAD approach, namely normal structure\nregularisation (NSReg), to achieve generalised detection ability to unseen\nanomalies, while maintaining its effectiveness on detecting seen anomalies. The\nkey idea in NSReg is to introduce a regularisation term that enforces the\nlearning of compact, semantically-rich representations of normal nodes based on\ntheir structural relations to other nodes. When being optimised with supervised\nanomaly detection losses, the regularisation term helps incorporate strong\nnormality into the modelling, and thus, it effectively avoids over-fitting the\nseen anomalies and learns a better normality decision boundary, largely\nreducing the false negatives of detecting unseen anomalies as normal. Extensive\nempirical results on seven real-world datasets show that NSReg significantly\noutperforms state-of-the-art competing methods by at least 14% AUC-ROC on the\nunseen anomaly classes and by 10% AUC-ROC on all anomaly classes.\n","authors":["Qizhou Wang","Guansong Pang","Mahsa Salehi","Xiaokun Xia","Christopher Leckie"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.06835v4.pdf","comment":null}],"Multimedia":[{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01737v1","updated":"2024-10-02T16:47:55Z","published":"2024-10-02T16:47:55Z","title":"RADAR: Robust Two-stage Modality-incomplete Industrial Anomaly Detection","summary":"  Multimodal Industrial Anomaly Detection (MIAD), utilizing 3D point clouds and\n2D RGB images to identify the abnormal region of products, plays a crucial role\nin industrial quality inspection.

User Field of View (FoV) is more dynamic with\n6-DoF movement than 3-DoF movement. To save bandwidth, FoV-adaptive streaming\npredicts a user's FoV and only downloads point cloud data falling in the\npredicted FoV. However, it is vulnerable to FoV prediction errors, which can be\nsignificant when a long buffer is utilized for smoothed streaming.

Linguistic theories, unfortunately, have not yet\nprovided an answer to this question. This paper presents QSALIENCE, a salience\npredictor of inquisitive questions. QSALIENCE is instruction-tuned over our\ndataset of linguist-annotated salience scores of 1,766 (context, question)\npairs.

With only a handful of\nexisting large-scale, domain-specific datasets, creation of new datasets is\nrequired in most applications. This requires the development of new\napplication-specific filtering of web-scale data. Filtering with a\nhigh-performance, general-purpose LLM such as GPT-4o can be highly effective,\nbut this is extremely expensive at web-scale. This paper proposes SIEVE, a\nlightweight alternative that matches GPT-4o accuracy at a fraction of the cost.\nSIEVE can perform up to 500 filtering operations for the cost of one GPT-4o\nfiltering call. The key to SIEVE is a seamless integration of GPT-4o and\nlightweight T5 models, using active learning to fine-tune T5 in the background\nwith a small number of calls to GPT-4o. Once trained, it performs as well as\nGPT-4o at a tiny fraction of the cost.

In\ncontrast, large language models (LLMs) autoregressively synthesize programs in\na single pass. One explanation for this is the scarcity of open-sourced edit\ndata. While high-quality instruction data for code synthesis is already scarce,\nhigh-quality edit data is even scarcer. To fill this gap, we develop a\nsynthetic data generation algorithm called LintSeq. This algorithm refactors\nexisting code into a sequence of code edits by using a linter to procedurally\nsample across the error-free insertions that can be used to sequentially write\nprograms. It outputs edit sequences as text strings consisting of consecutive\nprogram diffs. To test LintSeq, we use it to refactor a dataset of instruction\n+ program pairs into instruction + program-diff-sequence tuples. Then, we\ninstruction finetune a series of smaller LLMs ranging from 2.6B to 14B\nparameters on both the re-factored and original versions of this dataset,\ncomparing zero-shot performance on code synthesis benchmarks.

Despite their advanced language capabilities, when it comes to\ndomain-specific and knowledge-intensive tasks, LLMs suffer from hallucinations,\nknowledge cut-offs, and lack of knowledge attributions. Additionally, fine\ntuning LLMs' intrinsic knowledge to highly specific domains is an expensive and\ntime consuming process. The retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) process has\nrecently emerged as a method capable of optimization of LLM responses, by\nreferencing them to a predetermined ontology. It was shown that using a\nKnowledge Graph (KG) ontology for RAG improves the QA accuracy, by taking into\naccount relevant sub-graphs that preserve the information in a structured\nmanner. In this paper, we introduce SMART-SLIC, a highly domain-specific LLM\nframework, that integrates RAG with KG and a vector store (VS) that store\nfactual domain specific information. Importantly, to avoid hallucinations in\nthe KG, we build these highly domain-specific KGs and VSs without the use of\nLLMs, but via NLP, data mining, and nonnegative tensor factorization with\nautomatic model selection.

Ideally,\nLLMs should provide informative responses while avoiding the disclosure of\nharmful or sensitive information. However, current alignment approaches, which\nrely heavily on refusal strategies, such as training models to completely\nreject harmful prompts or applying coarse filters are limited by their binary\nnature. These methods either fully deny access to information or grant it\nwithout sufficient nuance, leading to overly cautious responses or failures to\ndetect subtle harmful content.

Each dilemma\nincludes two possible actions and with each action, the affected parties and\nhuman values invoked. Based on these dilemmas, we consolidated a set of human\nvalues across everyday topics e.g., interpersonal relationships, workplace, and\nenvironmental issues. We evaluated LLMs on these dilemmas to determine what\naction they will take and the values represented by these actions. Then, we\nanalyzed these values through the lens of five popular theories inspired by\nsociology, psychology and philosophy. These theories are: World Value Survey,\nMoral Foundation Theory, Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, Aristotle's Virtues, and\nPlutchik Wheel of Emotion. We find that LLMs are most aligned with the\nself-expression over survival values in terms of World Value Survey, care over\nloyalty in Moral Foundation Theory. Interestingly, we find large preferences\ndifferences in models for some core values such as truthfulness e.g.,\nMixtral-8x7B model tends to neglect it by 9.7% while GPT-4-turbo model tends to\nselect it by 9.4%.

However, web tasks, such as booking flights, usually involve\nusers' PII, which may be exposed to potential privacy risks if web agents\naccidentally interact with compromised websites, a scenario that remains\nlargely unexplored in the literature. In this work, we narrow this gap by\nconducting the first study on the privacy risks of generalist web agents in\nadversarial environments. First, we present a realistic threat model for\nattacks on the website, where we consider two adversarial targets: stealing\nusers' specific PII or the entire user request.

With strong language processing\ncapabilities and remarkable versatility, large language models (LLMs) have\nbecome popular choices for zero-shot re-ranking in IR systems. So far,\nLLM-based re-ranking methods rely on strong generative capabilities, which\nrestricts their use to either specialized or powerful proprietary models. Given\nthese restrictions, we ask: is autoregressive generation necessary and optimal\nfor LLMs to perform re-ranking? We hypothesize that there are abundant signals\nrelevant to re-ranking within LLMs that might not be used to their full\npotential via generation. To more directly leverage such signals, we propose\nin-context re-ranking (ICR), a novel method that leverages the change in\nattention pattern caused by the search query for accurate and efficient\nre-ranking. To mitigate the intrinsic biases in LLMs, we propose a calibration\nmethod using a content-free query. Due to the absence of generation, ICR only\nrequires two ($O(1)$) forward passes to re-rank $N$ documents, making it\nsubstantially more efficient than generative re-ranking methods that require at\nleast $O(N)$ forward passes.

How\nrobust are these models in encoding linguistic properties when faced with\nperturbations in the input text? However, these studies have mainly focused on\nBERT and the English language. In this paper, we investigate similar questions\nregarding encoding capability and robustness for 8 linguistic properties across\n13 different perturbations in 6 Indic languages, using 9 multilingual\nTransformer models (7 universal and 2 Indic-specific). To conduct this study,\nwe introduce a novel multilingual benchmark dataset, IndicSentEval, containing\napproximately $\\sim$47K sentences.

However, the traditional objective of maximizing sentence\nlog-likelihood (LL) does not explicitly account for the close relationship\nbetween the constituent structure and the semantics, resulting in a weak\ncorrelation between LL values and parsing accuracy. In this paper, we introduce\na novel objective for training unsupervised parsers: maximizing the information\nbetween constituent structures and sentence semantics (SemInfo). We introduce a\nbag-of-substrings model to represent the semantics and apply the\nprobability-weighted information metric to estimate the SemInfo. Additionally,\nwe develop a Tree Conditional Random Field (TreeCRF)-based model to apply the\nSemInfo maximization objective to Probabilistic Context-Free Grammar (PCFG)\ninduction, the state-of-the-art method for unsupervised constituency parsing.\nExperiments demonstrate that SemInfo correlates more strongly with parsing\naccuracy than LL.

Empowering large language models (LLMs) to reason over\ntabular data represents an actively explored direction.

In this paper, we first empirically demonstrate\nthe detrimental impact of such flattening operations on the performance of LLMs\nin capturing the spatial information of tables through two elaborate proxy\ntasks. Subsequently, we introduce a simple yet effective positional encoding\nmethod, termed ``2D-TPE'' (Two-Dimensional Table Positional Encoding), to\naddress this challenge. 2D-TPE enables each attention head to dynamically\nselect a permutation order of tokens within the context for attending to them,\nwhere each permutation represents a distinct traversal mode for the table, such\nas column-wise or row-wise traversal. 2D-TPE effectively mitigates the risk of\nlosing essential spatial information while preserving computational efficiency,\nthus better preserving the table structure.

DGA dynamically estimates the pre-training\ndata mixture on which the models' gradients align as well as possible with\nthose of the model on the specific task. DGA is the first gradient alignment\napproach that incurs minimal overhead compared to standard pre-training and\noutputs a competitive model, eliminating the need for retraining the model.\nExperimentally, we demonstrate significant improvements over importance\nsampling in two key scenarios: (i) when the pre-training set is small and\nimportance sampling overfits due to limited data; and (ii) when there is\ninsufficient specialized data, trapping importance sampling on narrow pockets\nof data.

Despite this, most VLT benchmarks still\ndepend on succinct, human-annotated text descriptions for each video. These\ndescriptions often fall short in capturing the nuances of video content\ndynamics and lack stylistic variety in language, constrained by their uniform\nlevel of detail and a fixed annotation frequency. As a result, algorithms tend\nto default to a \"memorize the answer\" strategy, diverging from the core\nobjective of achieving a deeper understanding of video content. Fortunately,\nthe emergence of large language models (LLMs) has enabled the generation of\ndiverse text. This work utilizes LLMs to generate varied semantic annotations\n(in terms of text lengths and granularities) for representative SOT benchmarks,\nthereby establishing a novel multi-modal benchmark.

Recently, representation\nengineering, a method which alters the model's behavior via changing its\nrepresentations post-training, was shown to be effective in aligning LLMs (Zou\net al., 2023a). Representation engineering yields gains in alignment oriented\ntasks such as resistance to adversarial attacks and reduction of social biases,\nbut was also shown to cause a decrease in the ability of the model to perform\nbasic tasks. In this paper we study the tradeoff between the increase in\nalignment and decrease in helpfulness of the model. We propose a theoretical\nframework which provides bounds for these two quantities, and demonstrate their\nrelevance empirically. First, we find that under the conditions of our\nframework, alignment can be guaranteed with representation engineering, and at\nthe same time that helpfulness is harmed in the process. Second, we show that\nhelpfulness is harmed quadratically with the norm of the representation\nengineering vector, while the alignment increases linearly with it, indicating\na regime in which it is efficient to use representation engineering.

We propose MOREL, a multi-objective feature representation learning\napproach, encouraging classification models to produce similar features for\ninputs within the same class, despite perturbations. Our training method\ninvolves an embedding space where cosine similarity loss and multi-positive\ncontrastive loss are used to align natural and adversarial features from the\nmodel encoder and ensure tight clustering. Concurrently, the classifier is\nmotivated to achieve accurate predictions. Through extensive experiments, we\ndemonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the robustness of DNNs\nagainst white-box and black-box adversarial attacks, outperforming other\nmethods that similarly require no architectural changes or test-time data\npurification.

With\nthe dataset, we build an end-to-end embodied agent, NatVLM, by fine-tuning a\nLarge Vision Language Model (LVLM) through imitation learning. The LVLM is\ntrained to take previous observations from the environment and generate the\nnext actions. We also introduce CoT explanation traces of the action prediction\nfor better performance when tuning LVLMs. Our extensive experiments find that\nwe can build a performant LVLM-based agent through imitation learning on the\nshortest paths constructed by a BFS planner without any human supervision. Our\nagent achieves a success rate that surpasses GPT-4o by over 20%.

To this end, we introduce\nControlAR, an efficient and effective framework for integrating spatial\ncontrols into autoregressive image generation models. Firstly, we explore\ncontrol encoding for AR models and propose a lightweight control encoder to\ntransform spatial inputs (e.g., canny edges or depth maps) into control tokens.\nThen ControlAR exploits the conditional decoding method to generate the next\nimage token conditioned on the per-token fusion between control and image\ntokens, similar to positional encodings. Compared to prefilling tokens, using\nconditional decoding significantly strengthens the control capability of AR\nmodels but also maintains the model's efficiency.

However, direct\nself-supervised stereo matching paradigms based on photometric loss functions\nhave consistently struggled with performance issues due to the occlusion\nchallenge. The crux of the occlusion challenge lies in the fact that the\npositions of occluded pixels consistently align with the epipolar search\ndirection defined by the input stereo images, leading to persistent information\nloss and erroneous feedback at fixed locations during self-supervised training.\nIn this work, we propose a simple yet highly effective pseudo-stereo inputs\nstrategy to address the core occlusion challenge. This strategy decouples the\ninput and feedback images, compelling the network to probabilistically sample\ninformation from both sides of the occluding objects. As a result, the\npersistent lack of information in the aforementioned fixed occlusion areas is\nmitigated. Building upon this, we further address feedback conflicts and\noverfitting issues arising from the strategy. By integrating these components,\nour method achieves stable and significant performance improvements compared to\nexisting methods. Quantitative experiments are conducted to evaluate the\nperformance. Qualitative experiments further demonstrate accurate disparity\ninference even at occluded regions. These results demonstrate a significant\nadvancement over previous methods in the field of direct self-supervised stereo\nmatching based on photometric loss. The proposed pseudo-stereo inputs strategy,\ndue to its simplicity and effectiveness, has the potential to serve as a new\nparadigm for direct self-supervised stereo matching.

High-frequency information, such\nas boundary details, is essential for achieving precise semantic segmentation\nin this context. To address these challenges, we propose HiFiSeg, a novel\nnetwork for colon polyp segmentation that enhances high-frequency information\nprocessing through a global-local vision transformer framework. HiFiSeg\nleverages the pyramid vision transformer (PVT) as its encoder and introduces\ntwo key modules: the global-local interaction module (GLIM) and the selective\naggregation module (SAM).

One example is tumor\ntreatment planning, which heavily depends on accurate estimates of the spatial\ndistribution of tumor cells in a patient's anatomy. Medical imaging scans can\nidentify the bulk of the tumor, but they cannot reveal its full spatial\ndistribution. Tumor cells at low concentrations remain undetectable, for\nexample, in the most frequent type of primary brain tumors, glioblastoma.\nDeep-learning-based approaches fail to estimate the complete tumor cell\ndistribution due to a lack of reliable training data. Most existing works\ntherefore rely on physics-based simulations to match observed tumors, providing\nanatomically and physiologically plausible estimations. However, these\napproaches struggle with complex and unknown initial conditions and are limited\nby overly rigid physical models.

Existing purification\nmethods attempt to mitigate this issue but often over-purify images, resulting\nin information loss. In this work, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the\nfine-tuning process of PDMs through the lens of shortcut learning. We\nhypothesize and empirically demonstrate that adversarial perturbations induce a\nlatent-space misalignment between images and their text prompts in the CLIP\nembedding space. This misalignment causes the model to erroneously associate\nnoisy patterns with unique identifiers during fine-tuning, resulting in poor\ngeneralization. Based on these insights, we propose a systematic defense\nframework that includes data purification and contrastive decoupling learning.\nWe first employ off-the-shelf image restoration techniques to realign images\nwith their original semantic meanings in latent space.

However, they may be limited in modeling large\ninter-subject variations in organ shapes and sizes and exploiting global\nlong-range contextual information. This is because CNNs typically employ\nconvolutions with fixed-sized local receptive fields and lack the mechanisms to\nutilize global information. To address these limitations, we developed Dynamic\nMulti-Resolution Convolution (DMRC) and Dynamic Multi-Scale Convolution (DMSC)\nmodules. Both modules enhance the representation capabilities of single\nconvolutions to capture varying scaled features and global contextual\ninformation. This is achieved in the DMRC module by employing a convolutional\nfilter on images with different resolutions and subsequently utilizing dynamic\nmechanisms to model global inter-dependencies between features. In contrast,\nthe DMSC module extracts features at different scales by employing convolutions\nwith different kernel sizes and utilizing dynamic mechanisms to extract global\ncontextual information. The utilization of convolutions with different kernel\nsizes in the DMSC module may increase computational complexity. To lessen this\nburden, we propose to use a lightweight design for convolution layers with a\nlarge kernel size. Thus, DMSC and DMRC modules are designed as lightweight\ndrop-in replacements for single convolutions, and they can be easily integrated\ninto general CNN architectures for end-to-end training. The segmentation\nnetwork was proposed by incorporating our DMSC and DMRC modules into a standard\nU-Net architecture, termed Dynamic Multi-scale and Multi-resolution Convolution\nnetwork (DMC-Net).

Current\nmethods fall short of accurately identifying and mitigating these\nhallucinations. To address this issue, we introduce ESREAL, a novel\nunsupervised learning framework designed to suppress the generation of\nhallucinations through accurate localization and penalization of hallucinated\ntokens. Initially, ESREAL creates a reconstructed image based on the generated\ncaption and aligns its corresponding regions with those of the original image.\nThis semantic reconstruction aids in identifying both the presence and type of\ntoken-level hallucinations within the generated caption. Subsequently, ESREAL\ncomputes token-level hallucination scores by assessing the semantic similarity\nof aligned regions based on the type of hallucination. Finally, ESREAL employs\na proximal policy optimization algorithm, where it selectively penalizes\nhallucinated tokens according to their token-level hallucination scores.

This limitation is evident in tasks that require precise\nvisual perception, like comparing geometric properties or solving visual\nreasoning problems. To study this failure mode, we focus on vector graphics --\nimages composed of 2D objects and shapes, prevalent in LMM-based tasks in web,\ndesign, and OS environments. We identify two key research questions: how can we\nenable precise visual perception, and how can we facilitate high-level\nreasoning based on such low-level perceptions? To capture fine visual details,\nwe use Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) for accurate encoding of visual scenes.\nHowever, SVGs are not readily interpretable by LMMs in a zero-shot manner. To\ntackle this, we propose the Visually Descriptive Language Model (VDLM), which\nintroduces a Primal Visual Description (PVD) as an intermediate textual\nrepresentation. PVD translates SVGs into a text-based abstraction consisting of\nprimitive attributes (e.g., shape, position, measurement) and their\ncorresponding values. PVD can be learned using task-agnostic synthesized data\nand represents visual primitives that are universal across vector graphics.\nThis abstraction is more structured, allowing for direct interpretation by\nfoundation models for zero-shot generalization.

Recent advancements in Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) have further enhanced the performance of embedding\nmodels, which are trained on massive amounts of text covering almost every\ndomain. These models are often benchmarked on general-purpose datasets like\nMassive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB), where they demonstrate superior\nperformance. However, a critical question arises: Is the development of\ndomain-specific embedding models necessary when general-purpose models are\ntrained on vast corpora that already include specialized domain texts? In this\npaper, we empirically investigate this question, choosing the finance domain as\nan example. We introduce the Finance Massive Text Embedding Benchmark\n(FinMTEB), a counterpart to MTEB that consists of financial domain-specific\ntext datasets. We evaluate the performance of seven state-of-the-art embedding\nmodels on FinMTEB and observe a significant performance drop compared to their\nperformance on MTEB. To account for the possibility that this drop is driven by\nFinMTEB's higher complexity, we propose four measures to quantify dataset\ncomplexity and control for this factor in our analysis. Our analysis provides\ncompelling evidence that state-of-the-art embedding models struggle to capture\ndomain-specific linguistic and semantic patterns.

Additionally, fine\ntuning LLMs' intrinsic knowledge to highly specific domains is an expensive and\ntime consuming process. The retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) process has\nrecently emerged as a method capable of optimization of LLM responses, by\nreferencing them to a predetermined ontology.

To facilitate the research of augmenting LLMs\nwith graphs, we manually construct a Graph Reasoning Benchmark dataset called\nGRBench, containing 1,740 questions that can be answered with the knowledge\nfrom 10 domain graphs.

However, in the recommendation domain, it remains uncertain\nwhether LMs implicitly encode user preference information. Contrary to\nprevailing understanding that LMs and traditional recommenders learn two\ndistinct representation spaces due to the huge gap in language and behavior\nmodeling objectives, this work re-examines such understanding and explores\nextracting a recommendation space directly from the language representation\nspace. Surprisingly, our findings demonstrate that item representations, when\nlinearly mapped from advanced LM representations, yield superior recommendation\nperformance. This outcome suggests the possible homomorphism between the\nadvanced language representation space and an effective item representation\nspace for recommendation, implying that collaborative signals may be implicitly\nencoded within LMs. Motivated by these findings, we explore the possibility of\ndesigning advanced collaborative filtering (CF) models purely based on language\nrepresentations without ID-based embeddings.

Operating\nwithin the framework of canonicalization, LieLAC can easily be integrated with\nunconstrained pre-trained models, transforming inputs to a canonical form\nbefore feeding them into the existing model, effectively aligning the input for\nmodel inference according to allowed symmetries. LieLAC utilizes standard Lie\ngroup descent schemes, achieving equivariance in pre-trained models. Finally,\nwe showcase LieLAC's efficacy on tasks of invariant image classification and\nLie point symmetry equivariant neural PDE solvers using pre-trained models.\n","authors":["Zakhar Shumaylov","Peter Zaika","James Rowbottom","Ferdia Sherry","Melanie Weber","Carola-Bibiane Schönlieb"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.02698v1.pdf","comment":"40 pages; preprint"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17917v2","updated":"2024-10-03T17:18:53Z","published":"2024-02-27T22:10:51Z","title":"Collaborative learning of common latent representations in routinely\n  collected multivariate ICU physiological signals","summary":"  In Intensive Care Units (ICU), the abundance of multivariate time series\npresents an opportunity for machine learning (ML) to enhance patient\nphenotyping.

This issue is even wider when processing medical data, where a lack of\nmethodological standards causes large variations being provided by different\nimaging centers or acquired with various devices and cofactors. To overcome\nthese limitations, we introduce a novel, generalizable, data- and task-agnostic\nframework able to extract salient features from medical images. The proposed\nquaternion wavelet network (QUAVE) can be easily integrated with any\npre-existing medical image analysis or synthesis task, and it can be involved\nwith real, quaternion, or hypercomplex-valued models, generalizing their\nadoption to single-channel data. QUAVE first extracts different sub-bands\nthrough the quaternion wavelet transform, resulting in both\nlow-frequency/approximation bands and high-frequency/fine-grained features.\nThen, it weighs the most representative set of sub-bands to be involved as\ninput to any other neural model for image processing, replacing standard data\nsamples. We conduct an extensive experimental evaluation comprising different\ndatasets, diverse image analysis, and synthesis tasks including reconstruction,\nsegmentation, and modality translation. We also evaluate QUAVE in combination\nwith both real and quaternion-valued models.

Two main approaches for\nlearning a reward model are 1) training an EXplicit Reward Model (EXRM) as in\nRLHF, and 2) using an implicit reward learned from preference data through\nmethods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).

Most existing MLC methods are based on\nthe assumption that the correlation of two labels in each label pair is\nsymmetric, which is violated in many real-world scenarios. Moreover, most\nexisting methods design learning processes associated with the number of\nlabels, which makes their computational complexity a bottleneck when scaling up\nto large-scale output space. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel method\nnamed Scalable Label Distribution Learning (SLDL) for multi-label\nclassification which can describe different labels as distributions in a latent\nspace, where the label correlation is asymmetric and the dimension is\nindependent of the number of labels. Specifically, SLDL first converts labels\ninto continuous distributions within a low-dimensional latent space and\nleverages the asymmetric metric to establish the correlation between different\nlabels. Then, it learns the mapping from the feature space to the latent space,\nresulting in the computational complexity is no longer related to the number of\nlabels. Finally, SLDL leverages a nearest-neighbor-based strategy to decode the\nlatent representations and obtain the final predictions.

How\nrobust are these models in encoding linguistic properties when faced with\nperturbations in the input text? However, these studies have mainly focused on\nBERT and the English language. In this paper, we investigate similar questions\nregarding encoding capability and robustness for 8 linguistic properties across\n13 different perturbations in 6 Indic languages, using 9 multilingual\nTransformer models (7 universal and 2 Indic-specific). To conduct this study,\nwe introduce a novel multilingual benchmark dataset, IndicSentEval, containing\napproximately $\\sim$47K sentences.

When coupled with\ncustom kernels that fuse the dequantization and matmul operations, weight-only\nquantization can thus enable faster inference by reducing the amount of memory\nmovement. However, developing high-performance kernels for weight-quantized\nLLMs presents substantial challenges, especially when the weights are\ncompressed to non-evenly-divisible bit widths (e.g., 3 bits) with non-uniform,\nlookup table (LUT) quantization.

Additionally, we draw a connection between CFG and\ngradient ascent and introduce a new rescaling and momentum method for the CFG\nupdate rule based on this insight. Our approach, termed adaptive projected\nguidance (APG), retains the quality-boosting advantages of CFG while enabling\nthe use of higher guidance scales without oversaturation. APG is easy to\nimplement and introduces practically no additional computational overhead to\nthe sampling process. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that APG is\ncompatible with various conditional diffusion models and samplers, leading to\nimproved FID, recall, and saturation scores while maintaining precision\ncomparable to CFG, making our method a superior plug-and-play alternative to\nstandard classifier-free guidance.\n","authors":["Seyedmorteza Sadat","Otmar Hilliges","Romann M.

However, existing methods fall short in addressing potential\nconflicts and complex correlations between tasks, especially in parameter-level\nadjustments, posing a challenge in effectively balancing parameter competition\nacross various tasks. This paper introduces an innovative technique named\nPCB-Merging (Parameter Competition Balancing), a lightweight and training-free\ntechnique that adjusts the coefficients of each parameter for effective model\nmerging. PCB-Merging employs intra-balancing to gauge parameter significance\nwithin individual tasks and inter-balancing to assess parameter similarities\nacross different tasks. Parameters with low importance scores are dropped, and\nthe remaining ones are rescaled to form the final merged model.

To address\nthis gap, we train LLMs that can ''interact to align'', essentially cultivating\nthe meta-skill of LLMs to implicitly infer the unspoken personalized\npreferences of the current user through multi-turn conversations, and then\ndynamically align their following behaviors and responses to these inferred\npreferences.

In addition, beyond the confidence scores, SaySelf initiates the\nprocess of directing LLMs to produce self-reflective rationales that clearly\nidentify gaps in their parametric knowledge and explain their uncertainty. This\nis achieved by using an LLM to automatically summarize the uncertainties in\nspecific knowledge via natural language.

This work systematically evaluates the utility of model merging at\nscale, examining the impact of these different factors. We experiment with\nmerging fully fine-tuned models using 4 popular merging methods -- Averaging,\nTask~Arithmetic, Dare, and TIES -- across model sizes ranging from 1B-64B\nparameters and merging up to 8 different expert models. We evaluate the merged\nmodels on both held-in tasks, i.e., the expert's training tasks, and zero-shot\ngeneralization to unseen held-out tasks.

Given these observations, we introduce a generate-then-select\nframework decomposing KPG into two steps, where we adopt a one2set-based model\nas generator to produce candidates and then use an LLM as selector to select\nkeyphrases from these candidates. Particularly, we make two important\nimprovements on our generator and selector: 1) we design an Optimal\nTransport-based assignment strategy to address the above improper assignments;\n2) we model the keyphrase selection as a sequence labeling task to alleviate\nredundant selections.

By providing a structured framework for understanding how\noccupations are gendered in both labour markets and MT systems, GOSt-MT\ncontributes to efforts aimed at making MT systems more equitable and reducing\ngender biases in automated translations.\n","authors":["Orfeas Menis Mastromichalakis","Giorgos Filandrianos","Eva Tsouparopoulou","Dimitris Parsanoglou","Maria Symeonaki","Giorgos Stamou"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.10989v2.pdf","comment":"Accepted at the KG-STAR'24: Workshop on Knowledge Graphs for\n  Responsible AI co-located with the 33rd ACM CIKM Conference, October 25,\n  2024, Boise, Idaho"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13933v2","updated":"2024-10-04T12:03:03Z","published":"2024-08-25T20:41:22Z","title":"MobileQuant: Mobile-friendly Quantization for On-device Language Models","summary":"  Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized language processing,\ndelivering outstanding results across multiple applications. However, deploying\nLLMs on edge devices poses several challenges with respect to memory, energy,\nand compute costs, limiting their widespread use in devices such as mobile\nphones. A promising solution is to reduce the number of bits used to represent\nweights and activations. While existing works have found partial success at\nquantizing LLMs to lower bitwidths, e.g. 4-bit weights, quantizing activations\nbeyond 16 bits often leads to large computational overheads due to poor\non-device quantization support, or a considerable accuracy drop. Yet, 8-bit\nactivations are very attractive for on-device deployment as they would enable\nLLMs to fully exploit mobile-friendly hardware, e.g. Neural Processing Units\n(NPUs). In this work, we make a first attempt to facilitate the on-device\ndeployment of LLMs using integer-only quantization. We first investigate the\nlimitations of existing quantization methods for on-device deployment, with a\nspecial focus on activation quantization. We then address these limitations by\nintroducing a simple post-training quantization method, named MobileQuant, that\nextends previous weight equivalent transformation works by jointly optimizing\nthe weight transformation and activation range parameters in an end-to-end\nmanner.

Current protocols to evaluate unlearning methods largely\nrely on behavioral tests, without monitoring the presence of unlearned\nknowledge within the model's parameters. This residual knowledge can be\nadversarially exploited to recover the erased information post-unlearning. We\nargue that unlearning should also be evaluated internally, by considering\nchanges in the parametric knowledge traces of the unlearned concepts. To this\nend, we propose a general evaluation methodology that leverages vocabulary\nprojections to inspect concepts encoded in model parameters. We use this\napproach to localize \"concept vectors\" - parameter vectors that encode concrete\nconcepts - and construct ConceptVectors, a benchmark dataset containing\nhundreds of common concepts and their parametric knowledge traces within two\nopen-source LLMs. Evaluation on ConceptVectors shows that existing unlearning\nmethods minimally impact concept vectors and mostly suppress them during\ninference, while directly ablating these vectors demonstrably removes the\nassociated knowledge and significantly reduces the model's susceptibility to\nadversarial manipulation.

In this work, we use experimental evidence and theoretical estimates to\nchallenge the common assumption that small-scale contamination renders\nbenchmark evaluations invalid. First, we experimentally quantify the magnitude\nof benchmark overfitting based on scaling along three dimensions: The number of\nmodel parameters (up to 1.6B), the number of times an example is seen (up to\n144), and the number of training tokens (up to 40B).

At the same time, even 144 times of contamination can be forgotten\nif the training data is scaled beyond five times Chinchilla, a regime\ncharacteristic of many modern LLMs. We then derive a simple theory of example\nforgetting via cumulative weight decay. It allows us to bound the number of\ngradient steps required to forget past data for any training run where we know\nthe hyperparameters of AdamW. This indicates that many LLMs, including Llama 3,\nhave forgotten the data seen at the beginning of training.

In terms of depth, we propose a multi-level diagnostic\nprocess, including (1) solvability detection, (2) solution planning, and (3)\nmissing-tool analysis. For breadth, we consider three scenarios based on the\ncharacteristics of the toolset: missing necessary tools, potential tools, and\nlimited functionality tools. Furthermore, we developed seven tasks and\ncollected 700 evaluation samples through multiple rounds of manual annotation.\nThe results show the significant challenges presented by the ToolBH benchmark.\nThe current advanced models Gemini-1.5-Pro and GPT-4o only achieve total scores\nof 45.3 and 37.0, respectively, on a scale of 100. In this benchmark, larger\nmodel parameters do not guarantee better performance; the training data and\nresponse strategies also play crucial roles in tool-enhanced LLM scenarios. Our\ndiagnostic analysis indicates that the primary reason for model errors lies in\nassessing task solvability. Additionally, open-weight models suffer from\nperformance drops with verbose replies, whereas proprietary models excel with\nlonger reasoning.\n","authors":["Yuxiang Zhang","Jing Chen","Junjie Wang","Yaxin Liu","Cheng Yang","Chufan Shi","Xinyu Zhu","Zihao Lin","Hanwen Wan","Yujiu Yang","Tetsuya Sakai","Tian Feng","Hayato Yamana"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.20015v2.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07867v3","updated":"2024-10-04T07:45:22Z","published":"2024-01-15T17:57:41Z","title":"Authorship Obfuscation in Multilingual Machine-Generated Text Detection","summary":"  High-quality text generation capability of recent Large Language Models\n(LLMs) causes concerns about their misuse (e.g., in massive generation/spread\nof disinformation).

Current watermarking\ntechniques offer high detectability, minimal impact on text quality, and\nrobustness to text editing. However, current researches lack investigation into\nthe imperceptibility of watermarking techniques in LLM services. This is\ncrucial as LLM providers may not want to disclose the presence of watermarks in\nreal-world scenarios, as it could reduce user willingness to use the service\nand make watermarks more vulnerable to attacks. This work is the first to\ninvestigate the imperceptibility of watermarked LLMs. We design an\nidentification algorithm called Water-Probe that detects watermarks through\nwell-designed prompts to the LLM. Our key motivation is that current\nwatermarked LLMs expose consistent biases under the same watermark key,\nresulting in similar differences across prompts under different watermark keys.\nExperiments show that almost all mainstream watermarking algorithms are easily\nidentified with our well-designed prompts, while Water-Probe demonstrates a\nminimal false positive rate for non-watermarked LLMs. Finally, we propose that\nthe key to enhancing the imperceptibility of watermarked LLMs is to increase\nthe randomness of watermark key selection. Based on this, we introduce the\nWater-Bag strategy, which significantly improves watermark imperceptibility by\nmerging multiple watermark keys.\n","authors":["Aiwei Liu","Sheng Guan","Yiming Liu","Leyi Pan","Yifei Zhang","Liancheng Fang","Lijie Wen","Philip S.

To address these\nlimitations, we propose Multi-LogiEval, a comprehensive evaluation dataset\nencompassing multi-step logical reasoning with various inference rules and\ndepths. Multi-LogiEval covers three logic types--propositional, first-order,\nand non-monotonic--consisting of more than 30 inference rules and more than 60\nof their combinations with various depths. Leveraging this dataset, we conduct\nevaluations on a range of LLMs including GPT-4, ChatGPT, Gemini-Pro, Yi, Orca,\nand Mistral, employing a zero-shot chain-of-thought. Experimental results show\nthat there is a significant drop in the performance of LLMs as the reasoning\nsteps/depth increases (average accuracy of ~68% at depth-1 to ~43% at depth-5).\nWe further conduct a thorough investigation of reasoning chains generated by\nLLMs which reveals several important findings. We believe that Multi-LogiEval\nfacilitates future research for evaluating and enhancing the logical reasoning\nability of LLMs. Data is available at\nhttps://github.com/Mihir3009/Multi-LogiEval.\n","authors":["Nisarg Patel","Mohith Kulkarni","Mihir Parmar","Aashna Budhiraja","Mutsumi Nakamura","Neeraj Varshney","Chitta Baral"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.17169v2.pdf","comment":"Accepted at EMNLP 2024 Main"}],"Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition":[{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03665v1","updated":"2024-10-04T17:59:57Z","published":"2024-10-04T17:59:57Z","title":"Estimating Body and Hand Motion in an Ego-sensed World","summary":"  We present EgoAllo, a system for human motion estimation from a head-mounted\ndevice.

For example, when a self-driving\ncar enters a new area, it may learn from other traffic participants whose\ndetectors have been optimized for that area.

Furthermore, those metrics enable tasks such as image retrieval,\nobject recognition and quality assessment, essential in fields like healthcare,\nastronomy and surveillance. Existing metrics, such as PSNR, MSE, SSIM, ISSM and\nFSIM, often face limitations in terms of either speed, complexity or\nsensitivity to small changes in images. To address these challenges, a novel\nimage similarity metric, namely CSIM, that combines real-time while being\nsensitive to subtle image variations is investigated in this paper. The novel\nmetric uses Gaussian Copula from probability theory to transform an image into\nvectors of pixel distribution associated to local image patches. These vectors\ncontain, in addition to intensities and pixel positions, information on the\ndependencies between pixel values, capturing the structural relationships\nwithin the image. By leveraging the properties of Copulas, CSIM effectively\nmodels the joint distribution of pixel intensities, enabling a more nuanced\ncomparison of image patches making it more sensitive to local changes compared\nto other metrics. Experimental results demonstrate that CSIM outperforms\nexisting similarity metrics in various image distortion scenarios, including\nnoise, compression artifacts and blur. The metric's ability to detect subtle\ndifferences makes it suitable for applications requiring high precision, such\nas medical imaging, where the detection of minor anomalies can be of a high\nimportance.

For general inverse problems, approximations are\nneeded when an unconditionally trained diffusion model is used since the\nmeasurement likelihood is intractable, leading to inaccurate posterior\nsampling. In other words, due to their approximations, these methods fail to\npreserve the generation process on the data manifold defined by the diffusion\nprior, leading to artifacts in applications such as image restoration. To\nenhance the performance and robustness of diffusion models in solving inverse\nproblems, we propose Diffusion State-Guided Projected Gradient (DiffStateGrad),\nwhich projects the measurement gradient onto a subspace that is a low-rank\napproximation of an intermediate state of the diffusion process. DiffStateGrad,\nas a module, can be added to a wide range of diffusion-based inverse solvers to\nimprove the preservation of the diffusion process on the prior manifold and\nfilter out artifact-inducing components. We highlight that DiffStateGrad\nimproves the robustness of diffusion models in terms of the choice of\nmeasurement guidance step size and noise while improving the worst-case\nperformance.

However, one major limitation of AR models is their sequential nature,\nwhich processes tokens one at a time, slowing down generation compared to\nmodels like GANs or diffusion-based methods that operate more efficiently.\nWhile speculative decoding has proven effective for accelerating LLMs by\ngenerating multiple tokens in a single forward, its application in visual AR\nmodels remains largely unexplored. In this work, we identify a challenge in\nthis setting, which we term \\textit{token selection ambiguity}, wherein visual\nAR models frequently assign uniformly low probabilities to tokens, hampering\nthe performance of speculative decoding. To overcome this challenge, we propose\na relaxed acceptance condition referred to as LANTERN that leverages the\ninterchangeability of tokens in latent space. This relaxation restores the\neffectiveness of speculative decoding in visual AR models by enabling more\nflexible use of candidate tokens that would otherwise be prematurely rejected.\nFurthermore, by incorporating a total variation distance bound, we ensure that\nthese speed gains are achieved without significantly compromising image quality\nor semantic coherence. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our\nmethod in providing a substantial speed-up over speculative decoding.

Recent developments allow for\ntext-guided inpainting, making sophisticated image edits possible with minimal\neffort. This poses new challenges for digital media forensics. For example,\ndiffusion model-based approaches could either splice the inpainted region into\nthe original image, or regenerate the entire image. In the latter case,\ntraditional image forgery localization (IFL) methods typically fail. This paper\nintroduces the Text-Guided Inpainting Forgery (TGIF) dataset, a comprehensive\ncollection of images designed to support the training and evaluation of image\nforgery localization and synthetic image detection (SID) methods. The TGIF\ndataset includes approximately 75k forged images, originating from popular\nopen-source and commercial methods, namely SD2, SDXL, and Adobe Firefly. We\nbenchmark several state-of-the-art IFL and SID methods on TGIF. Whereas\ntraditional IFL methods can detect spliced images, they fail to detect\nregenerated inpainted images.

Thus\nmotivated, we propose a novel approach, named Generative Edge Detector (GED),\nby fully utilizing the potential of the pre-trained stable diffusion model. Our\nmodel can be trained and inferred efficiently without specific network design\ndue to the rich high-level and low-level prior knowledge empowered by the\npre-trained stable diffusion. Specifically, we propose to finetune the\ndenoising U-Net and predict latent edge maps directly, by taking the latent\nimage feature maps as input. Additionally, due to the subjectivity and\nambiguity of the edges, we also incorporate the granularity of the edges into\nthe denoising U-Net model as one of the conditions to achieve controllable and\ndiverse predictions. Furthermore, we devise a granularity regularization to\nensure the relative granularity relationship of the multiple predictions. We\nconduct extensive experiments on multiple datasets and achieve competitive\nperformance (\\eg, 0.870 and 0.880 in terms of ODS and OIS on the BSDS test\ndataset).\n","authors":["Caixia Zhou","Yaping Huang","Mochu Xiang","Jiahui Ren","Haibin Ling","Jing Zhang"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.03080v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15576v2","updated":"2024-10-04T01:22:06Z","published":"2024-03-22T19:04:02Z","title":"Data-centric Prediction Explanation via Kernelized Stein Discrepancy","summary":"  Existing example-based prediction explanation methods often bridge test and\ntraining data points through the model's parameters or latent representations.\nWhile these methods offer clues to the causes of model predictions, they often\nexhibit innate shortcomings, such as incurring significant computational\noverhead or producing coarse-grained explanations.

To build SCoRe, we\nfirst show that variants of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on offline\nmodel-generated correction traces are often insufficient for instilling\nself-correction behavior. In particular, we observe that training via SFT falls\nprey to either a distribution mismatch between mistakes made by the\ndata-collection policy and the model's own responses, or to behavior collapse,\nwhere learning implicitly prefers only a certain mode of correction behavior\nthat is often not effective at self-correction on test problems. SCoRe\naddresses these challenges by training under the model's own distribution of\nself-generated correction traces and using appropriate regularization to steer\nthe learning process into learning a self-correction behavior that is effective\nat test time as opposed to fitting high-reward responses for a given prompt.\nThis regularization process includes an initial phase of multi-turn RL on a\nbase model to generate a policy initialization that is less susceptible to\ncollapse, followed by using a reward bonus to amplify self-correction. With\nGemini 1.0 Pro and 1.5 Flash models, we find that SCoRe achieves\nstate-of-the-art self-correction performance, improving the base models'\nself-correction by 15.6% and 9.1% respectively on MATH and HumanEval.\n","authors":["Aviral Kumar","Vincent Zhuang","Rishabh Agarwal","Yi Su","John D Co-Reyes","Avi Singh","Kate Baumli","Shariq Iqbal","Colton Bishop","Rebecca Roelofs","Lei M Zhang","Kay McKinney","Disha Shrivastava","Cosmin Paduraru","George Tucker","Doina Precup","Feryal Behbahani","Aleksandra Faust"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.12917v2.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20974v3","updated":"2024-10-04T17:23:48Z","published":"2024-05-31T16:21:16Z","title":"SaySelf: Teaching LLMs to Express Confidence with Self-Reflective\n  Rationales","summary":"  Large language models (LLMs) often generate inaccurate or fabricated\ninformation and generally fail to indicate their confidence, which limits their\nbroader applications. Previous work elicits confidence from LLMs by direct or\nself-consistency prompting, or constructing specific datasets for supervised\nfinetuning. The prompting-based approaches have inferior performance, and the\ntraining-based approaches are limited to binary or inaccurate group-level\nconfidence estimates. In this work, we present the advanced SaySelf, a training\nframework that teaches LLMs to express more accurate fine-grained confidence\nestimates. In addition, beyond the confidence scores, SaySelf initiates the\nprocess of directing LLMs to produce self-reflective rationales that clearly\nidentify gaps in their parametric knowledge and explain their uncertainty. This\nis achieved by using an LLM to automatically summarize the uncertainties in\nspecific knowledge via natural language. The summarization is based on the\nanalysis of the inconsistency in multiple sampled reasoning chains, and the\nresulting data is utilized for supervised fine-tuning. Moreover, we utilize\nreinforcement learning with a meticulously crafted reward function to calibrate\nthe confidence estimates, motivating LLMs to deliver accurate, high-confidence\npredictions and to penalize overconfidence in erroneous outputs. Experimental\nresults in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of SaySelf in reducing the confidence calibration error and\nmaintaining the task performance.

This community-wide\nenthusiasm has sparked a plethora of approaches. Nevertheless, a systematic\nstudy to understand their performance and suitable application scenarios is\nlacking, leaving questions like when to apply PETL and which approach to use\nlargely unanswered. In this paper, we conduct a unifying empirical study of\nrepresentative PETL methods in the context of Vision Transformers. We\nsystematically tune their hyper-parameters to fairly compare their accuracy on\ndownstream tasks. Our study not only offers a valuable user guide but also\nunveils several new insights. First, if tuned carefully, different PETL methods\ncan obtain similar accuracy in the low-shot benchmark VTAB-1K. This includes\nsimple methods like FT the bias terms that were reported inferior. Second,\nthough with similar accuracy, we find that PETL methods make different mistakes\nand high-confidence predictions, likely due to their different inductive\nbiases. Such an inconsistency (or complementariness) opens up the opportunity\nfor ensemble methods, and we make preliminary attempts at this. Third, going\nbeyond the commonly used low-shot tasks, we find that PETL is also useful in\nmany-shot regimes -- it achieves comparable and sometimes better accuracy than\nfull FT, using much fewer learnable parameters. Last but not least, we\ninvestigate PETL's ability to preserve a pre-trained model's robustness to\ndistribution shifts (e.g., a CLIP backbone). Perhaps not surprisingly, PETL\nmethods outperform full FT alone. However, with weight-space ensembles, the\nfully fine-tuned model can better balance target (i.e., downstream)\ndistribution and distribution shift performance, suggesting a future research\ndirection for PETL.\n","authors":["Zheda Mai","Ping Zhang","Cheng-Hao Tu","Hong-You Chen","Li Zhang","Wei-Lun Chao"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.16434v3.pdf","comment":"Code is available at https://github.com/OSU-MLB/PETL_Vision"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10570v2","updated":"2024-10-04T16:34:17Z","published":"2022-08-22T19:58:03Z","title":"Semi-Supervised Manifold Learning with Complexity Decoupled Chart\n  Autoencoders","summary":"  Autoencoding is a popular method in representation learning.

This paper demonstrates that IBP is\nsub-optimal in the first case due to its susceptibility to the wrapping effect.\nEven for linear activation, IBP gives strongly sub-optimal bounds.\nConsequently, one should use strategies immune to the wrapping effect to obtain\nbounds close to optimal ones. We adapt two classical approaches dedicated to\nstrict computations -- Dubleton Arithmetic and Affine Arithmetic -- to mitigate\nthe wrapping effect in neural networks. These techniques yield precise results\nfor networks with linear activation functions, thus resisting the wrapping\neffect. As a result, we achieve bounds significantly closer to the optimal\nlevel than IBPs.\n","authors":["Patryk Krukowski","Daniel Wilczak","Jacek Tabor","Anna Bielawska","Przemysław Spurek"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.03373v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18338v2","updated":"2024-10-04T12:39:37Z","published":"2024-09-26T23:23:27Z","title":"AQMLator -- An Auto Quantum Machine Learning E-Platform","summary":"  A successful Machine Learning (ML) model implementation requires three main\ncomponents: training dataset, suitable model architecture and training\nprocedure.

However, we found that naive\nfeature alignment employed in existing TTA methods for classification is\nineffective or even worse for regression because the features are distributed\nin a small subspace and many of the raw feature dimensions have little\nsignificance to the output. For an effective feature alignment in TTA for\nregression, we propose Significant-subspace Alignment (SSA). SSA consists of\ntwo components: subspace detection and dimension weighting. Subspace detection\nfinds the feature subspace that is representative and significant to the\noutput. Then, the feature alignment is performed in the subspace during TTA.\nMeanwhile, dimension weighting raises the importance of the dimensions of the\nfeature subspace that have greater significance to the output. We\nexperimentally show that SSA outperforms various baselines on real-world\ndatasets.\n","authors":["Kazuki Adachi","Shin'ya Yamaguchi","Atsutoshi Kumagai","Tomoki Hamagami"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.03263v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01524v2","updated":"2024-10-04T09:25:27Z","published":"2024-10-02T13:12:13Z","title":"HarmAug: Effective Data Augmentation for Knowledge Distillation of\n  Safety Guard Models","summary":"  Safety guard models that detect malicious queries aimed at large language\nmodels (LLMs) are essential for ensuring the secure and responsible deployment\nof LLMs in real-world applications.

However, the commonly used Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs)\nsuffer from limited expressive power and struggle to capture long-range\ndependencies. Graph transformers offer a strong alternative due to their global\nattention mechanism, but they come with great computational overheads,\nespecially for large graphs. In recent years, State Space Models (SSMs) have\nemerged as a compelling approach to replace full attention in transformers to\nmodel sequential data.

However,\nwhat has not been reviewed is whether spatio-temporal relationships are even\nrequired to achieve state-of-the-art results. Previous work in activity\nrecognition has found biases, by prioritizing static cues such as scenes or\nobjects, over motion information. In this paper we inquire if similar spurious\nrelationships might influence the task of video summarization. To do so, we\nanalyse the role that temporal information plays on existing benchmark\ndatasets. We first estimate a baseline with temporally invariant models to see\nhow well such models rank on benchmark datasets (TVSum and SumMe). We then\ndisrupt the temporal order of the videos to investigate the impact it has on\nexisting state-of-the-art models. One of our findings is that the temporally\ninvariant models achieve competitive correlation scores that are close to the\nhuman baselines on the TVSum dataset.

Furthermore, with certain\ndisruption strategies that shuffle fixed time segments, we can actually improve\ntheir correlation scores.

Recent developments allow for\ntext-guided inpainting, making sophisticated image edits possible with minimal\neffort. This poses new challenges for digital media forensics. For example,\ndiffusion model-based approaches could either splice the inpainted region into\nthe original image, or regenerate the entire image. In the latter case,\ntraditional image forgery localization (IFL) methods typically fail. This paper\nintroduces the Text-Guided Inpainting Forgery (TGIF) dataset, a comprehensive\ncollection of images designed to support the training and evaluation of image\nforgery localization and synthetic image detection (SID) methods. The TGIF\ndataset includes approximately 75k forged images, originating from popular\nopen-source and commercial methods, namely SD2, SDXL, and Adobe Firefly. We\nbenchmark several state-of-the-art IFL and SID methods on TGIF. Whereas\ntraditional IFL methods can detect spliced images, they fail to detect\nregenerated inpainted images. Moreover, traditional SID may detect the\nregenerated inpainted images to be fake, but cannot localize the inpainted\narea. Finally, both IFL and SID methods fail when exposed to stronger\ncompression, while they are less robust to modern compression algorithms, such\nas WEBP. In conclusion, this work demonstrates the inefficiency of\nstate-of-the-art detectors on local manipulations performed by modern\ngenerative approaches, and aspires to help with the development of more capable\nIFL and SID methods.

To tackle robust event modeling in multimodal settings, we\nintroduce a multimodal formulation for partially-defined events and cast the\nextraction of these events as a three-stage span retrieval task.

In this paper, we\npropose SFTMix, a novel recipe that elevates instruction-tuning performance\nbeyond the conventional NTP paradigm, without the need for well-curated\ndatasets. Observing that LLMs exhibit uneven confidence across the semantic\nrepresentation space, we argue that examples with different confidence levels\nshould play distinct roles during the instruction-tuning process. Based on this\ninsight, SFTMix leverages training dynamics to identify examples with varying\nconfidence levels, then applies a Mixup-based regularization to mitigate\noverfitting on confident examples while propagating supervision signals to\nimprove learning on relatively unconfident ones. This approach enables SFTMix\nto significantly outperform NTP across a wide range of instruction-following\nand healthcare domain-specific SFT tasks, demonstrating its adaptability to\ndiverse LLM families and scalability to datasets of any size.

In contrast, the Warmup-Stable-Decay (WSD) schedule uses a\nconstant learning rate to produce a main branch of iterates that can in\nprinciple continue indefinitely without a pre-specified compute budget. Then,\ngiven any compute budget, one can branch out from the main branch at a proper\nat any time with a rapidly decaying learning rate to produce a strong model.\nEmpirically, WSD generates a non-traditional loss curve: the loss remains\nelevated during the stable phase but sharply declines during the decay phase.\nTowards explaining this phenomenon, we conjecture that pretraining loss\nexhibits a river valley landscape, which resembles a deep valley with a river\nat its bottom. Under this assumption, we show that during the stable phase, the\niterate undergoes large oscillations due to the high learning rate, yet it\nprogresses swiftly along the river. During the decay phase, the rapidly\ndropping learning rate minimizes the iterate's oscillations, moving it closer\nto the river and revealing true optimization progress. Therefore, the sustained\nhigh learning rate phase and fast decaying phase are responsible for progress\nin the river and the mountain directions respectively, and are both critical.\nOur analysis predicts phenomenons consistent with empirical observations and\nshows that this landscape can emerge from pretraining on a simple bi-gram\ndataset. Inspired by the theory, we introduce WSD-S, a variant of WSD that\nreuses previous checkpoints' decay phases and keeps only one main branch, where\nwe resume from a decayed checkpoint.

For lossless LLM\ndecoding acceleration, Speculative Decoding (SD) has emerged as a promising\nsolution. However, applying SD to generative recommendation presents unique\nchallenges due to the requirement of generating top-K items (i.e., K distinct\ntoken sequences) as a recommendation list by beam search. This leads to more\nstringent verification in SD, where all the top-K sequences from the target LLM\nmust be successfully drafted by the draft model at each decoding step. To\nalleviate this, we consider 1) boosting top-K sequence alignment between the\ndraft model and the target LLM, and 2) relaxing the verification strategy to\nreduce trivial LLM calls. To this end, we propose an alignment framework named\nAtSpeed, which presents the AtSpeed-S optimization objective for top-K\nalignment under the strict top-K verification.

In this paper, we find that editing\neither long-term memory (direct model parameters) or working memory\n(non-parametric knowledge of neural network activations/representations by\nretrieval) will result in an impossible triangle -- reliability,\ngeneralization, and locality can not be realized together in the lifelong\nediting settings. For long-term memory, directly editing the parameters will\ncause conflicts with irrelevant pretrained knowledge or previous edits (poor\nreliability and locality). For working memory, retrieval-based activations can\nhardly make the model understand the edits and generalize (poor\ngeneralization). Therefore, we propose WISE to bridge the gap between memories.\nIn WISE, we design a dual parametric memory scheme, which consists of the main\nmemory for the pretrained knowledge and a side memory for the edited knowledge.\nWe only edit the knowledge in the side memory and train a router to decide\nwhich memory to go through when given a query.

However, the limited\ncontext awareness of LLMs degrades their performance on RAG tasks. Existing\nmethods to enhance context awareness are often inefficient, incurring time or\nmemory overhead during inference, and many are tailored to specific position\nembeddings. In this paper, we propose Position-Embedding-Agnostic attention\nRe-weighting (PEAR), which enhances the context awareness of LLMs with zero\ninference overhead. Specifically, on a proxy task focused on context copying,\nwe first detect heads which suppress the models' context awareness thereby\ndiminishing RAG performance. To weaken the impact of these heads, we re-weight\ntheir outputs with learnable coefficients. The LLM (with frozen parameters) is\noptimized by adjusting these coefficients to minimize loss on the proxy task.\nAs a result, the coefficients are optimized to values less than one, thereby\nreducing their tendency to suppress RAG performance. During inference, the\noptimized coefficients are fixed to re-weight these heads, regardless of the\nspecific task at hand.

However, to meet these requirements\nin the Transformer model, the norm of the model parameters must be non-uniform,\nand thus, parameters whose norm is smaller are more sensitive to the parameter\nupdate. To address this issue, we propose a novel technique, weight scaling as\nreparameterization (WeSaR). WeSaR introduces a gate parameter per parameter\nmatrix and adjusts it to the value satisfying the requirements. Because of the\ngate parameter, WeSaR sets the norm of the original parameters uniformly, which\nresults in stable training.

However, SAEs are\nusually trained separately on each transformer layer, making it difficult to\nuse them to study how information flows across layers. To solve this problem,\nwe introduce the multi-layer SAE (MLSAE): a single SAE trained on the residual\nstream activation vectors from every transformer layer. Given that the residual\nstream is understood to preserve information across layers, we expected MLSAE\nlatents to `switch on' at a token position and remain active at later layers.\nInterestingly, we find that individual latents are often active at a single\nlayer for a given token or prompt, but this layer may differ for different\ntokens or prompts. We quantify these phenomena by defining a distribution over\nlayers and considering its variance. We find that the variance of the\ndistributions of latent activations over layers is about two orders of\nmagnitude greater when aggregating over tokens compared with a single token.\nFor larger underlying models, the degree to which latents are active at\nmultiple layers increases, which is consistent with the fact that the residual\nstream activation vectors at adjacent layers become more similar.

Hence, we expect that the desired positional\nencoding should be data-adaptive and can be dynamically adjusted with the given\nattention. In this paper, we propose a Data-Adaptive Positional Encoding (DAPE)\nmethod, which dynamically and semantically adjusts based on input context and\nlearned fixed priors.

By unifying the space of whole-image\nembeddings and dense visual features and then applying voxel-wise encoding\nmodels to these features, we enable the identification of specific subregions\nof each image which drive selectivity patterns in different areas of the higher\nvisual cortex. We validate BrainSAIL on cortical regions with known category\nselectivity, demonstrating its ability to accurately localize and disentangle\nselectivity to diverse visual concepts.

Existing methods\ntypically generate short, isolated motions based on a single input sentence.\nHowever, human motions are continuous and can extend over long periods,\ncarrying rich semantics. Creating long, complex motions that precisely respond\nto streams of text descriptions, particularly in an online and real-time\nsetting, remains a significant challenge. Furthermore, incorporating spatial\nconstraints into text-conditioned motion generation presents additional\nchallenges, as it requires aligning the motion semantics specified by text\ndescriptions with geometric information, such as goal locations and 3D scene\ngeometry. To address these limitations, we propose DART, a Diffusion-based\nAutoregressive motion primitive model for Real-time Text-driven motion control.\nOur model, DART, effectively learns a compact motion primitive space jointly\nconditioned on motion history and text inputs using latent diffusion models. By\nautoregressively generating motion primitives based on the preceding history\nand current text input, DART enables real-time, sequential motion generation\ndriven by natural language descriptions.

The vanilla Gaussian Splatting, designed for camera models, cannot\nbe directly applied to LiDAR re-simulation. To bridge the gap between passive\ncamera and active LiDAR, our LiDAR-GS designs a differentiable laser beam\nsplatting, grounded in the LiDAR range view model.

However, the high dimensionality of hyperspectral data and\ninformation redundancy pose challenges to the application of Mamba in HSI\nclassification, suffering from suboptimal performance and computational\nefficiency. In light of this, this paper investigates a lightweight Interval\nGroup Spatial-Spectral Mamba framework (IGroupSS-Mamba) for HSI classification,\nwhich allows for multi-directional and multi-scale global spatial-spectral\ninformation extraction in a grouping and hierarchical manner. Technically, an\nInterval Group S6 Mechanism (IGSM) is developed as the core component, which\npartitions high-dimensional features into multiple non-overlapping groups at\nintervals, and then integrates a unidirectional S6 for each group with a\nspecific scanning direction to achieve non-redundant sequence modeling.\nCompared to conventional applying multi-directional scanning to all bands, this\ngrouping strategy leverages the complementary strengths of different scanning\ndirections while decreasing computational costs. To adequately capture the\nspatial-spectral contextual information, an Interval Group Spatial-Spectral\nBlock (IGSSB) is introduced, in which two IGSM-based spatial and spectral\noperators are cascaded to characterize the global spatial-spectral relationship\nalong the spatial and spectral dimensions, respectively.

While LLMs exhibit impressive skills in\ngeneral program synthesis and analysis, symbolic graphics programs offer a new\nlayer of evaluation: they allow us to test an LLM's ability to answer\ndifferent-grained semantic-level questions of the images or 3D geometries\nwithout a vision encoder. To semantically understand the symbolic programs,\nLLMs would need to possess the ability to \"imagine\" and reason how the\ncorresponding graphics content would look with only the symbolic description.\nWe use this task to evaluate LLMs by creating a large benchmark for the\nsemantic visual understanding of symbolic graphics programs, built procedurally\nwith minimal human effort. Particular emphasis is placed on transformations of\nimages that leave the image level semantics invariant while introducing\nsignificant changes to the underlying program. We evaluate commercial and\nopen-source LLMs on our benchmark to assess their ability to reason about\nvisual output of programs, finding that LLMs considered stronger at reasoning\ngenerally perform better. Lastly, we introduce a novel method to improve this\nability -- Symbolic Instruction Tuning (SIT), in which the LLM is finetuned\nwith pre-collected instruction data on symbolic graphics programs.\nInterestingly, we find that SIT not only improves LLM's understanding on\nsymbolic programs, but it also improves general reasoning ability on various\nother benchmarks.\n","authors":["Zeju Qiu","Weiyang Liu","Haiwen Feng","Zhen Liu","Tim Z.

In this paper, we propose a latent\ndiffusion model-based remote sensing image compression (LDM-RSIC) method, which\naims to enhance the final decoding quality of RS images by utilizing the\ngenerated distortion prior from a LDM. Our approach consists of two stages. In\nthe first stage, a self-encoder learns prior from the high-quality input image.\nIn the second stage, the prior is generated through an LDM, conditioned on the\ndecoded image of an existing learning-based image compression algorithm, to be\nused as auxiliary information for generating the texture-rich enhanced image.\nTo better utilize the prior, a channel attention and gate-based dynamic feature\nattention module (DFAM) is embedded into a Transformer-based multi-scale\nenhancement network (MEN) for image enhancement.

As\nthe number of DDN layers increases, the representational space of the outputs\nexpands exponentially, and the generated samples become increasingly similar to\nthe GT.

While most studies\nfocus on evaluating the capabilities of state-of-the-art (SoTA) MLLM models\nthrough task accuracy (e.g., Visual Question Answering, grounding) across\nvarious datasets, our work explores the related but complementary aspect of\nconsistency - the ability of an MLLM model to produce semantically similar or\nidentical responses to semantically similar queries. We note that consistency\nis a fundamental prerequisite (necessary but not sufficient condition) for\nrobustness and trust in MLLMs. Humans, in particular, are known to be highly\nconsistent (even if not always accurate) in their responses, and consistency is\ninherently expected from AI systems.

To\novercome these limitations, we introduce a novel two-stage approach for\nconsistent and photorealistic lensless image reconstruction.

However, ARMs often suffer from exponential error accumulation\nover long sequences, leading to physically implausible results, while DMs are\nlimited by their local context generation capabilities. In this work, we\nintroduce Autoregressive Coherent multimodal generation with Diffusion\nCorrection (ACDC), a zero-shot approach that combines the strengths of both\nARMs and DMs at the inference stage without the need for additional\nfine-tuning. ACDC leverages ARMs for global context generation and\nmemory-conditioned DMs for local correction, ensuring high-quality outputs by\ncorrecting artifacts in generated multimodal tokens.

For lossless LLM\ndecoding acceleration, Speculative Decoding (SD) has emerged as a promising\nsolution. However, applying SD to generative recommendation presents unique\nchallenges due to the requirement of generating top-K items (i.e., K distinct\ntoken sequences) as a recommendation list by beam search. This leads to more\nstringent verification in SD, where all the top-K sequences from the target LLM\nmust be successfully drafted by the draft model at each decoding step. To\nalleviate this, we consider 1) boosting top-K sequence alignment between the\ndraft model and the target LLM, and 2) relaxing the verification strategy to\nreduce trivial LLM calls. To this end, we propose an alignment framework named\nAtSpeed, which presents the AtSpeed-S optimization objective for top-K\nalignment under the strict top-K verification.

Where the updated knowledge resides in memories is a\nfundamental question for model editing. In this paper, we find that editing\neither long-term memory (direct model parameters) or working memory\n(non-parametric knowledge of neural network activations/representations by\nretrieval) will result in an impossible triangle -- reliability,\ngeneralization, and locality can not be realized together in the lifelong\nediting settings. For long-term memory, directly editing the parameters will\ncause conflicts with irrelevant pretrained knowledge or previous edits (poor\nreliability and locality). For working memory, retrieval-based activations can\nhardly make the model understand the edits and generalize (poor\ngeneralization). Therefore, we propose WISE to bridge the gap between memories.\nIn WISE, we design a dual parametric memory scheme, which consists of the main\nmemory for the pretrained knowledge and a side memory for the edited knowledge.\nWe only edit the knowledge in the side memory and train a router to decide\nwhich memory to go through when given a query. For continual editing, we devise\na knowledge-sharding mechanism where different sets of edits reside in distinct\nsubspaces of parameters, and are subsequently merged into a shared memory\nwithout conflicts.

Existing methods for\nactivation quantization mainly address channel-wise outliers, often neglecting\ntoken-wise outliers, leading to reliance on costly per-token dynamic\nquantization. To address this, we introduce PrefixQuant, a novel technique that\nisolates outlier tokens offline without re-training. Specifically, PrefixQuant\nidentifies high-frequency outlier tokens and prefixes them in the KV cache,\npreventing the generation of outlier tokens during inference and simplifying\nquantization. To our knowledge, PrefixQuant is the first to enable efficient\nper-tensor static quantization to outperform expensive per-token dynamic\nquantization. For instance, in W4A4KV4 (4- bit weight, 4-bit activation, and\n4-bit KV cache) Llama-3-8B, PrefixQuant with per-tensor static quantization\nachieves a 7.43 WikiText2 perplexity and 71.08% average accuracy on 5\ncommon-sense reasoning tasks, outperforming previous per-token dynamic\nquantization methods like QuaRot with 0.98 perplexity improvement and +5.98\npoints accuracy.

We investigate the influence of bias\non interval lengths of two different types of adjustments -- symmetric\nadjustments, the conventional method where both sides of the interval are\nadjusted equally, and asymmetric adjustments, a more flexible method where the\ninterval can be adjusted unequally in positive or negative directions. We\npresent theoretical and empirical analyses characterizing how symmetric and\nasymmetric adjustments impact the \"tightness\" of CP intervals for regression\ntasks.

To address the limitations of both on- and off-policy RLHF,\nwe propose a preference optimization method that aligns DMs with preferences\nwithout relying on reward models or paired human-annotated data.

In contrast, the Warmup-Stable-Decay (WSD) schedule uses a\nconstant learning rate to produce a main branch of iterates that can in\nprinciple continue indefinitely without a pre-specified compute budget. Then,\ngiven any compute budget, one can branch out from the main branch at a proper\nat any time with a rapidly decaying learning rate to produce a strong model.\nEmpirically, WSD generates a non-traditional loss curve: the loss remains\nelevated during the stable phase but sharply declines during the decay phase.\nTowards explaining this phenomenon, we conjecture that pretraining loss\nexhibits a river valley landscape, which resembles a deep valley with a river\nat its bottom. Under this assumption, we show that during the stable phase, the\niterate undergoes large oscillations due to the high learning rate, yet it\nprogresses swiftly along the river. During the decay phase, the rapidly\ndropping learning rate minimizes the iterate's oscillations, moving it closer\nto the river and revealing true optimization progress. Therefore, the sustained\nhigh learning rate phase and fast decaying phase are responsible for progress\nin the river and the mountain directions respectively, and are both critical.\nOur analysis predicts phenomenons consistent with empirical observations and\nshows that this landscape can emerge from pretraining on a simple bi-gram\ndataset.

For the first design, we\ninitially consider a linear model and characterize the entire equivariant space\nthat satisfies this constraint. This characterization gives rise to a novel\nfusion layer between different channels that satisfies an invariance-symmetry\n(IS) constraint, which we call an IS layer. We then extend this design beyond\nlinear models, similar to equitune, consisting of equivariant and IS layers. We\nalso show that the IS layer is a universal approximator of invariant-symmetric\nfunctions. Inspired by the first design, we use the notion of the IS property\nto design a second efficient model-agnostic equivariant design for large\nproduct groups acting on a single input. For the first design, we provide\nexperiments on multi-image classification where each view is transformed\nindependently with transformations such as rotations.

In this study, we present a systematic evaluation of\npersonas in system prompts. We curate a list of 162 roles covering 6 types of\ninterpersonal relationships and 8 domains of expertise.

Prior work has shown that an ensemble of models is\nmore resilient to transferability: the probability that an adversarial example\nis effective against most models of the ensemble is low. Thus, most ongoing\nresearch focuses on improving ensemble diversity. Another line of prior work\nhas shown that Lipschitz continuity of the models can make models more robust\nsince it limits how a model's output changes with small input perturbations. In\nthis paper, we study the effect of Lipschitz continuity on transferability\nrates. We show that although a lower Lipschitz constant increases the\nrobustness of a single model, it is not as beneficial in training robust\nensembles as it increases the transferability rate of adversarial examples\nacross models in the ensemble. Therefore, we introduce LOTOS, a new training\nparadigm for ensembles, which counteracts this adverse effect. It does so by\npromoting orthogonality among the top-$k$ sub-spaces of the transformations of\nthe corresponding affine layers of any pair of models in the ensemble. We\ntheoretically show that $k$ does not need to be large for convolutional layers,\nwhich makes the computational overhead negligible. Through various experiments,\nwe show LOTOS increases the robust accuracy of ensembles of ResNet-18 models by\n$6$ percentage points (p.p) against black-box attacks on CIFAR-10.

For long-term memory, directly editing the parameters will\ncause conflicts with irrelevant pretrained knowledge or previous edits (poor\nreliability and locality). For working memory, retrieval-based activations can\nhardly make the model understand the edits and generalize (poor\ngeneralization).

Yet, this\noperational paradigm introduces additional attack surfaces, particularly in\ncustom GPTs and hijacked chat sessions. In this paper, we introduce a\nstraightforward yet potent Conversation Reconstruction Attack. This attack\ntargets the contents of previous conversations between GPT models and benign\nusers, i.e., the benign users' input contents during their interaction with GPT\nmodels. The adversary could induce GPT models to leak such contents by querying\nthem with designed malicious prompts. Our comprehensive examination of privacy\nrisks during the interactions with GPT models under this attack reveals GPT-4's\nconsiderable resilience. We present two advanced attacks targeting improved\nreconstruction of past conversations, demonstrating significant privacy leakage\nacross all models under these advanced techniques. Evaluating various defense\nmechanisms, we find them ineffective against these attacks. Our findings\nhighlight the ease with which privacy can be compromised in interactions with\nGPT models, urging the community to safeguard against potential abuses of these\nmodels' capabilities.\n","authors":["Junjie Chu","Zeyang Sha","Michael Backes","Yang Zhang"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02987v2.pdf","comment":"Accepted in EMNLP 2024. 14 pages, 10 figures"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19339v2","updated":"2024-10-07T12:05:55Z","published":"2024-09-28T12:49:16Z","title":"Visual Question Decomposition on Multimodal Large Language Models","summary":"  Question decomposition has emerged as an effective strategy for prompting\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) to answer complex questions.

However, SAEs are\nusually trained separately on each transformer layer, making it difficult to\nuse them to study how information flows across layers. To solve this problem,\nwe introduce the multi-layer SAE (MLSAE): a single SAE trained on the residual\nstream activation vectors from every transformer layer. Given that the residual\nstream is understood to preserve information across layers, we expected MLSAE\nlatents to `switch on' at a token position and remain active at later layers.\nInterestingly, we find that individual latents are often active at a single\nlayer for a given token or prompt, but this layer may differ for different\ntokens or prompts. We quantify these phenomena by defining a distribution over\nlayers and considering its variance. We find that the variance of the\ndistributions of latent activations over layers is about two orders of\nmagnitude greater when aggregating over tokens compared with a single token.\nFor larger underlying models, the degree to which latents are active at\nmultiple layers increases, which is consistent with the fact that the residual\nstream activation vectors at adjacent layers become more similar. Finally, we\nrelax the assumption that the residual stream basis is the same at every layer\nby applying pre-trained tuned-lens transformations, but our findings remain\nqualitatively similar.

Therefore, addressing\nthe AC optimal power flow (AC-OPF) effectively becomes increasingly essential.\nThe AC-OPF, which is a fundamental optimization problem in power systems, must\nbe solved more frequently to ensure the safe and cost-effective operation of\npower systems. Due to its non-linear nature, AC-OPF is often solved in its\nlinearized form, despite inherent inaccuracies. Non-linear solvers, such as the\ninterior point method, are typically employed to solve the full OPF problem.\nHowever, these iterative methods may not converge for large systems and do not\nguarantee global optimality. This work explores a physics-informed graph neural\nnetwork, PINCO, to solve the AC-OPF. We demonstrate that this method provides\naccurate solutions in a fraction of the computational time when compared to the\nestablished non-linear programming solvers. Remarkably, PINCO generalizes\neffectively across a diverse set of loading conditions in the power system. We\nshow that our method can solve the AC-OPF without violating inequality\nconstraints. Furthermore, it can function both as a solver and as a hybrid\nuniversal function approximator. Moreover, the approach can be easily adapted\nto different power systems with minimal adjustments to the hyperparameters,\nincluding systems with multiple generators at each bus. Overall, this work\ndemonstrates an advancement in the field of power system optimization to tackle\nthe challenges of the energy transition.

While powerful methods\nfor dynamical systems reconstruction (DSR) exist when data come from a single\ndomain, how to best integrate data from multiple dynamical regimes and leverage\nit for generalization is still an open question. This becomes particularly\nimportant when individual time series are short, and group-level information\nmay help to fill in for gaps in single-domain data. At the same time, averaging\nis not an option in DSR, as it will wipe out crucial dynamical properties\n(e.g., limit cycles in one domain vs. chaos in another). Hence, a framework is\nneeded that enables to efficiently harvest group-level (multi-domain)\ninformation while retaining all single-domain dynamical characteristics. Here\nwe provide such a hierarchical approach and showcase it on popular DSR\nbenchmarks, as well as on neuroscientific and medical time series. In addition\nto faithful reconstruction of all individual dynamical regimes, our\nunsupervised methodology discovers common low-dimensional feature spaces in\nwhich datasets with similar dynamics cluster. The features spanning these\nspaces were further dynamically highly interpretable, surprisingly in often\nlinear relation to control parameters that govern the dynamics of the\nunderlying system.

Under the hood, language models support\nthis by running an autoregressive inference pass to provide a draft.\nConsequently, providing $k$ drafts to the user requires running an expensive\nlanguage model $k$ times. To alleviate the computation cost of running $k$\ninference passes, we propose Superposed Decoding, a new decoding algorithm that\ngenerates $k$ drafts at the computation cost of one autoregressive inference\npass. We achieve this by feeding a superposition of the most recent token\nembeddings from the $k$ drafts as input to the next decoding step of the\nlanguage model. At every inference step we combine the $k$ drafts with the\ntop-$k$ tokens to get $k^2$ new drafts and cache the $k$ most likely options,\nusing an n-gram interpolation with minimal compute overhead to filter out\nincoherent generations. Our experiments show that $k$ drafts from Superposed\nDecoding are at least as coherent and factual as Nucleus Sampling and Greedy\nDecoding respectively, while being at least $2.44\\times$ faster for $k\\ge3$. In\na compute-normalized setting, user evaluations demonstrably favor text\ngenerated by Superposed Decoding over Nucleus Sampling.

The most successful\nand most commonly used fine-tuning method is to update the pre-trained weights\nvia a low-rank adaptation (LoRA). LoRA introduces new weight matrices that are\nusually initialized at random with a uniform rank distribution across model\nweights. Recent works focus on weight-driven initialization or learning of\nadaptive ranks during training. Both approaches have only been investigated in\nisolation, resulting in slow convergence or a uniform rank distribution, in\nturn leading to sub-optimal performance. We propose to enhance LoRA by\ninitializing the new weights in a data-driven manner by computing singular\nvalue decomposition on minibatches of activation vectors. Then, we initialize\nthe LoRA matrices with the obtained right-singular vectors and re-distribute\nranks among all weight matrices to explain the maximal amount of variance and\ncontinue the standard LoRA fine-tuning procedure.

However, current neural speech\nrepresentations lack structure, resulting in dense token sequences that are\ncostly to process. To bridge this gap, we propose a new model, Sylber, that\nproduces speech representations with clean and robust syllabic structure.\nSpecifically, we propose a self-supervised model that regresses features on\nsyllabic segments distilled from a teacher model which is an exponential moving\naverage of the model in training. This results in a highly structured\nrepresentation of speech features, offering three key benefits: 1) a fast,\nlinear-time syllable segmentation algorithm, 2) efficient syllabic tokenization\nwith an average of 4.27 tokens per second, and 3) syllabic units better suited\nfor lexical and syntactic understanding. We also train token-to-speech\ngenerative models with our syllabic units and show that fully intelligible\nspeech can be reconstructed from these tokens. Lastly, we observe that\ncategorical perception, a linguistic phenomenon of speech perception, emerges\nnaturally in our model, making the embedding space more categorical and sparse\nthan previous self-supervised learning approaches.

However, most publicly available RNNs (e.g., Mamba\nand RWKV) are trained on sequences with less than 10K tokens, and their\neffectiveness in longer contexts remains largely unsatisfying so far. In this\npaper, we study the cause of the inability to process long context for RNNs and\nsuggest critical mitigations. We examine two practical concerns when applying\nstate-of-the-art RNNs to long contexts: (1) the inability to extrapolate to\ninputs longer than the training length and (2) the upper bound of memory\ncapacity. Addressing the first concern, we first investigate *state collapse*\n(SC), a phenomenon that causes severe performance degradation on sequence\nlengths not encountered during training. With controlled experiments, we\nattribute this to overfitting due to the recurrent state being\noverparameterized for the training length. For the second concern, we train a\nseries of Mamba-2 models on long documents to empirically estimate the\nrecurrent state capacity in language modeling and passkey retrieval. Then,\nthree SC mitigation methods are proposed to improve Mamba-2's length\ngeneralizability, allowing the model to process more than 1M tokens without SC.\nWe also find that the recurrent state capacity in passkey retrieval scales\nexponentially to the state size, and we empirically train a Mamba-2 370M with\nnear-perfect passkey retrieval accuracy on 256K context length.

At the core of chatbots are the\nNatural Language Understanding platforms (NLUs), which enable them to\ncomprehend and respond to user queries. Before deploying NLUs, there is a need\nto train them with labeled data. However, acquiring such labeled data for SE\nchatbots is challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality datasets. This\nchallenge arises because training SE chatbots requires specialized vocabulary\nand phrases not found in typical language datasets. Consequently, chatbot\ndevelopers often resort to manually annotating user queries to gather the data\nnecessary for training effective chatbots, a process that is both\ntime-consuming and resource-intensive. Previous studies propose approaches to\nsupport chatbot practitioners in annotating users' posed queries. However,\nthese approaches require human intervention to generate rules, called labeling\nfunctions (LFs), that identify and categorize user queries based on specific\npatterns in the data. To address this issue, we propose an approach to\nautomatically generate LFs by extracting patterns from labeled user queries. We\nevaluate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to the queries of\nfour diverse SE datasets (namely AskGit, MSA, Ask Ubuntu, and Stack Overflow)\nand measure the performance improvement gained from training the NLU on the\nqueries labeled by the generated LFs. We find that the generated LFs\neffectively label data with AUC scores of up to 85.3%, and NLU's performance\nimprovement of up to 27.2% across the studied datasets. Furthermore, our\nresults show that the number of LFs used to generate LFs affects the labeling\nperformance. We believe that our approach can save time and resources in\nlabeling users' queries, allowing practitioners to focus on core chatbot\nfunctionalities.\n","authors":["Ebube Alor","Ahmad Abdellatif","SayedHassan Khatoonabadi","Emad Shihab"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.07094v1.pdf","comment":"Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering for review"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07083v1","updated":"2024-10-09T17:24:28Z","published":"2024-10-09T17:24:28Z","title":"Stanceformer: Target-Aware Transformer for Stance Detection","summary":"  The task of Stance Detection involves discerning the stance expressed in a\ntext towards a specific subject or target.

Firstly, to thoroughly evaluate how well\nmodels align with different types of information and the quality of their\noutputs, we introduce a new benchmark, APEval (Assist Programming Eval), to\ncomprehensively assess the performance of models in programming assistance\ntasks. Then, for data collection, we develop a data generation pipeline,\nProgramming-Instruct, which synthesizes training data from diverse sources,\nsuch as GitHub and online judge platforms. This pipeline can automatically\ngenerate various types of messages throughout the programming process. Finally,\nusing this pipeline, we generate 219K samples, fine-tune multiple models, and\ndevelop the CursorCore series. We show that CursorCore outperforms other models\nof comparable size. This framework unifies applications such as inline chat and\nautomated editing, contributes to the advancement of coding assistants.

Despite current practices of adding personas to\nsystem prompts, it remains unclear how different personas affect a model's\nperformance on objective tasks. In this study, we present a systematic\nevaluation of personas in system prompts. We curate a list of 162 roles\ncovering 6 types of interpersonal relationships and 8 domains of expertise.\nThrough extensive analysis of 4 popular families of LLMs and 2,410 factual\nquestions, we demonstrate that adding personas in system prompts does not\nimprove model performance across a range of questions compared to the control\nsetting where no persona is added. Nevertheless, further analysis suggests that\nthe gender, type, and domain of the persona can all influence the resulting\nprediction accuracies.

Furthermore, the way in which these parts are combined\nmaintains a kind of locality: words are usually concatenated together, and they\nform contiguous phrases, keeping related parts of sentences close to each\nother. We address the challenge of understanding how these basic properties of\nlanguage arise from broader principles of efficient communication under\ninformation processing constraints. Here we show that natural-language-like\nsystematicity arises in codes that are constrained by predictive information, a\nmeasure of the amount of information that must be extracted from the past of a\nsequence in order to predict its future.

Next, in a series of\ncross-linguistic corpus studies, we show that human languages are structured to\nhave low predictive information at the levels of phonology, morphology, syntax,\nand semantics.

In this work, I extend the idea of\nactive steering with vectors that represent a behavioral direction of interest\nto tuning those vectors directly into the model, obviating the need for online\ncontrol. First, I identify activation vectors related to honesty in an\nopen-source LLM (Llama- 2-13b-chat). Next, I demonstrate that model output can\nbe made more or less honest by adding positive or negative multiples of these\nvectors to residual stream activations during generation. Then, I show that a\nsimilar effect can be achieved by fine-tuning the vectors directly into the\nmodel, by use of a dual loss function based on the cosine similarity of\nresidual stream activations to the vectors combined with a standard token-based\nloss (\"representation tuning\"). Finally, I compare the generations in response\nto honesty-probing prompts from the resulting models to those from models\nfine-tuned with a token-based loss alone, and to those from the untuned model\nsubjected to online steering. Overall, fine-tuning the vectors into the models\nusing the cosine similarity plus token loss showed a stronger effect than\nonline steering, and generalized better than using the standard loss,\nsuggesting the potential utility of this approach as a safety measure.

The frames of a speaker contain enough prosodic\ninformation overlap which is key in speech separation. Based on this, we\nimplement a self-supervised learning to learn to minimize the distance between\nframes belonging to a given speaker.

We\nanalyze 28 representative LLMs based on RACE and find that: 1) current\ncorrectness-centric benchmarks fail to capture the multifaceted requirements of\ncode in real-world scenarios, while RACE provides a comprehensive evaluation\nthat reveals the defects of LLMs across multiple dimensions; 2) the RACE\nbenchmark serves as an effective tool for resisting the risk of data\ncontamination; 3) even the most advanced code LLMs still encounter significant\nchallenges in customized requirements involving complex instructions; 4) most\nLLMs exhibit an inherent preference for specific coding style. These findings\nhighlight the need for a multidimensional evaluation of code LLMs, emphasizing\nmetrics beyond correctness for real-world applications.

To this end, we introduce a Convex Hull\nAdaptive Shift based multi-Entity action recognition method (CHASE), which\nmitigates inter-entity distribution gaps and unbiases subsequent backbones.\nSpecifically, CHASE comprises a learnable parameterized network and an\nauxiliary objective. The parameterized network achieves plausible,\nsample-adaptive repositioning of skeleton sequences through two key components.\nFirst, the Implicit Convex Hull Constrained Adaptive Shift ensures that the new\norigin of the coordinate system is within the skeleton convex hull. Second, the\nCoefficient Learning Block provides a lightweight parameterization of the\nmapping from skeleton sequences to their specific coefficients in convex\ncombinations. Moreover, to guide the optimization of this network for\ndiscrepancy minimization, we propose the Mini-batch Pair-wise Maximum Mean\nDiscrepancy as the additional objective.

However, due to\nthe agnostic impact of the discretization process, the hard network struggles\nwith the equivalent representational capacity as the soft network, namely\ndiscretization gap, which severely spoils the pruning performance. In this\npaper, we first investigate the discretization gap and propose a novel\nstructural differentiable mask pruning framework named S2HPruner to bridge the\ndiscretization gap in a one-stage manner. In the training procedure, SH2Pruner\nforwards both the soft network and its corresponding hard network, then\ndistills the hard network under the supervision of the soft network. To\noptimize the mask and prevent performance degradation, we propose a decoupled\nbidirectional knowledge distillation.

The techniques of machine\nunlearning, also known as concept erasing, have been developed to address these\nrisks. However, these techniques remain vulnerable to adversarial prompt\nattacks, which can prompt DMs post-unlearning to regenerate undesired images\ncontaining concepts (such as nudity) meant to be erased. This work aims to\nenhance the robustness of concept erasing by integrating the principle of\nadversarial training (AT) into machine unlearning, resulting in the robust\nunlearning framework referred to as AdvUnlearn. However, achieving this\neffectively and efficiently is highly nontrivial. First, we find that a\nstraightforward implementation of AT compromises DMs' image generation quality\npost-unlearning. To address this, we develop a utility-retaining regularization\non an additional retain set, optimizing the trade-off between concept erasure\nrobustness and model utility in AdvUnlearn. Moreover, we identify the text\nencoder as a more suitable module for robustification compared to UNet,\nensuring unlearning effectiveness. And the acquired text encoder can serve as a\nplug-and-play robust unlearner for various DM types. Empirically, we perform\nextensive experiments to demonstrate the robustness advantage of AdvUnlearn\nacross various DM unlearning scenarios, including the erasure of nudity,\nobjects, and style concepts. In addition to robustness, AdvUnlearn also\nachieves a balanced tradeoff with model utility.

First, we optimize the network structure of\ns-MLLM by integrating a sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture into the\nlanguage model, striking a balance between computational efficiency and model\nexpressiveness. Second, we propose a progressive knowledge transfer strategy to\nensure comprehensive knowledge migration. This strategy begins with mimic\ndistillation, where we minimize the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between\noutput distributions to enable the student model to emulate the teacher\nnetwork's understanding. Following this, we introduce preference distillation\nvia Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), where the key lies in treating l-MLLM\nas the reference model. During this phase, the s-MLLM's ability to discriminate\nbetween superior and inferior examples is significantly enhanced beyond l-MLLM,\nleading to a better student that surpasses its teacher, particularly in\nhallucination benchmarks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLaVA-MoD\noutperforms existing models across various multimodal benchmarks while\nmaintaining a minimal number of activated parameters and low computational\ncosts.

LF images inherently possess rich spatial and angular information.\nNonetheless, there is a scarcity of DA methodologies explicitly tailored for LF\nimages, and existing works tend to concentrate solely on either the spatial or\nangular domain. This paper proposes a novel spatial and angular DA strategy\nnamed MaskBlur for LF image SR by concurrently addressing spatial and angular\naspects. MaskBlur consists of spatial blur and angular dropout two components.\nSpatial blur is governed by a spatial mask, which controls where pixels are\nblurred, i.e., pasting pixels between the low-resolution and high-resolution\ndomains. The angular mask is responsible for angular dropout, i.e., selecting\nwhich views to perform the spatial blur operation. By doing so, MaskBlur\nenables the model to treat pixels differently in the spatial and angular\ndomains when super-resolving LF images rather than blindly treating all pixels\nequally.

Despite the importance, existing 3D\nreconstruction methods encounter several challenges, including stringent\ndemands for accuracy, imprecise camera positioning, intricate dynamic scenes,\nand the necessity for rapid reconstruction. Addressing these issues, this paper\npresents the first camera-pose-free scene reconstruction framework, Free-DyGS,\ntailored for dynamic surgical videos, leveraging 3D Gaussian splatting\ntechnology. Our approach employs a frame-by-frame reconstruction strategy and\nis delineated into four distinct phases: Scene Initialization, Joint Learning,\nScene Expansion, and Retrospective Learning. We introduce a Generalizable\nGaussians Parameterization module within the Scene Initialization and Expansion\nphases to proficiently generate Gaussian attributes for each pixel from the\nRGBD frames. The Joint Learning phase is crafted to concurrently deduce scene\ndeformation and camera pose, facilitated by an innovative flexible deformation\nmodule. In the scene expansion stage, the Gaussian points gradually grow as the\ncamera moves. The Retrospective Learning phase is dedicated to enhancing the\nprecision of scene deformation through the reassessment of prior frames. The\nefficacy of the proposed Free-DyGS is substantiated through experiments on two\ndatasets: the StereoMIS and Hamlyn datasets.

Recently proposed tree-based deep\nrecommendation models alleviate the problem by directly learning tree structure\nand representations under the guidance of recommendation objectives. To\nguarantee the effectiveness of beam search for recommendation accuracy, these\nmodels strive to ensure that the tree adheres to the max-heap assumption, where\na parent node's preference should be the maximum among its children's\npreferences. However, they employ a one-versus-all strategy, framing the\ntraining task as a series of independent binary classification objectives for\neach node, which limits their ability to fully satisfy the max-heap assumption.\nTo this end, we propose a Deep Tree-based Retriever (DTR for short) for\nefficient recommendation. DTR frames the training task as a softmax-based\nmulti-class classification over tree nodes at the same level, enabling explicit\nhorizontal competition and more discriminative top-k selection among them,\nwhich mimics the beam search behavior during training.

Unfortunately, the performance of\nFedSeqRec is still unsatisfactory because the models used in FedSeqRec have to\nbe lightweight to accommodate communication bandwidth and clients' on-device\ncomputational resource constraints. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have\nexhibited strong transferable and generalized language understanding abilities\nand therefore, in the NLP area, many downstream tasks now utilize LLMs as a\nservice to achieve superior performance without constructing complex models.\nInspired by this successful practice, we propose a generic FedSeqRec framework,\nFELLAS, which aims to enhance FedSeqRec by utilizing LLMs as an external\nservice. Specifically, FELLAS employs an LLM server to provide both item-level\nand sequence-level representation assistance. The item-level representation\nservice is queried by the central server to enrich the original ID-based item\nembedding with textual information, while the sequence-level representation\nservice is accessed by each client. However, invoking the sequence-level\nrepresentation service requires clients to send sequences to the external LLM\nserver. To safeguard privacy, we implement dx-privacy satisfied sequence\nperturbation, which protects clients' sensitive data with guarantees.\nAdditionally, a contrastive learning-based method is designed to transfer\nknowledge from the noisy sequence representation to clients' sequential\nrecommendation models. Furthermore, to empirically validate the privacy\nprotection capability of FELLAS, we propose two interacted item inference\nattacks. Extensive experiments conducted on three datasets with two widely used\nsequential recommendation models demonstrate the effectiveness and\nprivacy-preserving capability of FELLAS.\n","authors":["Wei Yuan","Chaoqun Yang","Guanhua Ye","Tong Chen","Quoc Viet Hung Nguyen","Hongzhi Yin"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.04927v2.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06618v1","updated":"2024-10-09T07:14:49Z","published":"2024-10-09T07:14:49Z","title":"Decomposing Relationship from 1-to-N into N 1-to-1 for Text-Video\n  Retrieval","summary":"  Text-video retrieval (TVR) has seen substantial advancements in recent years,\nfueled by the utilization of pre-trained models and large language models\n(LLMs).

In this paper, we propose\nText-Video-ProxyNet (TV-ProxyNet), a novel framework designed to decompose the\nconventional 1-to-N relationship of TVR into N distinct 1-to-1 relationships.\nBy replacing a single text query with a series of text proxies, TV-ProxyNet not\nonly broadens the query scope but also achieves a more precise expansion.

However, most publicly available RNNs (e.g., Mamba\nand RWKV) are trained on sequences with less than 10K tokens, and their\neffectiveness in longer contexts remains largely unsatisfying so far. In this\npaper, we study the cause of the inability to process long context for RNNs and\nsuggest critical mitigations. We examine two practical concerns when applying\nstate-of-the-art RNNs to long contexts: (1) the inability to extrapolate to\ninputs longer than the training length and (2) the upper bound of memory\ncapacity. Addressing the first concern, we first investigate *state collapse*\n(SC), a phenomenon that causes severe performance degradation on sequence\nlengths not encountered during training. With controlled experiments, we\nattribute this to overfitting due to the recurrent state being\noverparameterized for the training length. For the second concern, we train a\nseries of Mamba-2 models on long documents to empirically estimate the\nrecurrent state capacity in language modeling and passkey retrieval. Then,\nthree SC mitigation methods are proposed to improve Mamba-2's length\ngeneralizability, allowing the model to process more than 1M tokens without SC.\nWe also find that the recurrent state capacity in passkey retrieval scales\nexponentially to the state size, and we empirically train a Mamba-2 370M with\nnear-perfect passkey retrieval accuracy on 256K context length.

Such an assumption is\nreasonable in many scientific applications that require finding groups of\nlow-level variables, such as extracting regions from geographically gridded\nmeasurement data in climate research or capturing brain regions from neural\nactivity data. We demonstrate the identifiability of the resulting model and\npropose a differentiable method, Causal Discovery with Single-parent Decoding\n(CDSD), that simultaneously learns the underlying latents and a causal graph\nover them. We assess the validity of our theoretical results using simulated\ndata and showcase the practical validity of our method in an application to\nreal-world data from the climate science field.\n","authors":["Philippe Brouillard","Sébastien Lachapelle","Julia Kaltenborn","Yaniv Gurwicz","Dhanya Sridhar","Alexandre Drouin","Peer Nowack","Jakob Runge","David Rolnick"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.07013v1.pdf","comment":"33 pages, 17 figures"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07003v1","updated":"2024-10-09T15:48:56Z","published":"2024-10-09T15:48:56Z","title":"Through the Looking Glass: Mirror Schrödinger Bridges","summary":"  Resampling from a target measure whose density is unknown is a fundamental\nproblem in mathematical statistics and machine learning.

Each\ntext proxy is crafted through a refined iterative process, controlled by\nmechanisms we term as the director and dash, which regulate the proxy's\ndirection and distance relative to the original text query. This setup not only\nfacilitates more precise semantic alignment but also effectively manages the\ndisparities and noise inherent in multimodal data. Our experiments on three\nrepresentative video-text retrieval benchmarks, MSRVTT, DiDeMo, and ActivityNet\nCaptions, demonstrate the effectiveness of TV-ProxyNet. The results show an\nimprovement of 2.0% to 3.3% in R@1 over the baseline. TV-ProxyNet achieved\nstate-of-the-art performance on MSRVTT and ActivityNet Captions, and a 2.0%\nimprovement on DiDeMo compared to existing methods, validating our approach's\nability to enhance semantic mapping and reduce error propensity.\n","authors":["Jian Xiao","Zhenzhen Hu","Jia Li","Richang Hong"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.06618v1.pdf","comment":null}]},"2024-10-08T00:00:00Z":{"Computation and Language":[{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06428v1","updated":"2024-10-08T23:49:31Z","published":"2024-10-08T23:49:31Z","title":"Stress Detection on Code-Mixed Texts in Dravidian Languages using\n  Machine Learning","summary":"  Stress is a common feeling in daily life, but it can affect mental well-being\nin some situations, the development of robust detection models is imperative.\nThis study introduces a methodical approach to the stress identification in\ncode-mixed texts for Dravidian languages.

They operate by maintaining a set of vectors -- often referred to\nas the codebook -- and quantizing each encoder output to the nearest vector in\nthe codebook. However, as vector quantization is non-differentiable, the\ngradient to the encoder flows around the vector quantization layer rather than\nthrough it in a straight-through approximation. This approximation may be\nundesirable as all information from the vector quantization operation is lost.\nIn this work, we propose a way to propagate gradients through the vector\nquantization layer of VQ-VAEs.

In its\noriginal framing, an ARC task requires solving a program synthesis problem over\nsmall 2D images using a few input-output training pairs. In this work, we adopt\nthe recently popular data-driven approach to the ARC and ask whether a Vision\nTransformer (ViT) can learn the implicit mapping, from input image to output\nimage, that underlies the task. We show that a ViT -- otherwise a\nstate-of-the-art model for images -- fails dramatically on most ARC tasks even\nwhen trained on one million examples per task. This points to an inherent\nrepresentational deficiency of the ViT architecture that makes it incapable of\nuncovering the simple structured mappings underlying the ARC tasks. Building on\nthese insights, we propose ViTARC, a ViT-style architecture that unlocks some\nof the visual reasoning capabilities required by the ARC.

One approach for tackling this problem is rectified flows,\nwhich iteratively learn smooth ODE paths that are less susceptible to\ntruncation error. However, rectified flows still require a relatively large\nnumber of function evaluations (NFEs). In this work, we propose improved\ntechniques for training rectified flows, allowing them to compete with\n\\emph{knowledge distillation} methods even in the low NFE setting. Our main\ninsight is that under realistic settings, a single iteration of the Reflow\nalgorithm for training rectified flows is sufficient to learn nearly straight\ntrajectories; hence, the current practice of using multiple Reflow iterations\nis unnecessary. We thus propose techniques to improve one-round training of\nrectified flows, including a U-shaped timestep distribution and LPIPS-Huber\npremetric. With these techniques, we improve the FID of the previous\n2-rectified flow by up to 75\\% in the 1 NFE setting on CIFAR-10. On ImageNet\n64$\\times$64, our improved rectified flow outperforms the state-of-the-art\ndistillation methods such as consistency distillation and progressive\ndistillation in both one-step and two-step settings and rivals the performance\nof improved consistency training (iCT) in FID.

Due to this\ntone imbalance, machine learning models derived from these datasets can perform\nwell at detecting skin cancer for lighter skin tones. Any tone bias in these\nmodels could introduce fairness concerns and reduce public trust in the\nartificial intelligence health field.\n  Methods: We examine a subset of images from the International Skin Imaging\nCollaboration (ISIC) archive that provide tone information. The subset has a\nsignificant tone imbalance. These imbalances could explain a model's tone bias.\nTo address this, we train models using the imbalanced dataset and a balanced\ndataset to compare against. The datasets are used to train a deep convolutional\nneural network model to classify the images as malignant or benign. We then\nevaluate the models' disparate impact, based on selection rate, relative to\ndark or light skin tone.\n  Results: Using the imbalanced dataset, we found that the model is\nsignificantly better at detecting malignant images in lighter tone resulting in\na disparate impact of 0.577. Using the balanced dataset, we found that the\nmodel is also significantly better at detecting malignant images in lighter\nversus darker tones with a disparate impact of 0.684. Using the imbalanced or\nbalanced dataset to train the model still results in a disparate impact well\nbelow the standard threshold of 0.80 which suggests the model is biased with\nrespect to skin tone.\n  Conclusion: The results show that typical skin cancer machine learning models\ncan be tone biased. These results provide evidence that diagnosis or tone\nimbalance is not the cause of the bias.

Current approaches\nprimarily apply graph-based networks to extract framewise, whole-body-level\nmotion representations, and use one-hot encoded labels for model optimization.\nHowever, whole-body motion representations do not capture fine-grained\npart-level motion representations and the one-hot encoded labels neglect the\nintrinsic semantic relationships within the language-based action definitions.\nTo address these limitations, we propose a novel method named Language-assisted\nHuman Part Motion Representation Learning (LPL), which contains a Disentangled\nPart Motion Encoder (DPE) to extract dual-level (i.e., part and whole-body)\nmotion representations and a Language-assisted Distribution Alignment (LDA)\nstrategy for optimizing spatial relations within representations.

For lossless LLM\ndecoding acceleration, Speculative Decoding (SD) has emerged as a promising\nsolution. However, applying SD to generative recommendation presents unique\nchallenges due to the requirement of generating top-K items (i.e., K distinct\ntoken sequences) as a recommendation list by beam search. This leads to more\nstringent verification in SD, where all the top-K sequences from the target LLM\nmust be successfully drafted by the draft model at each decoding step. To\nalleviate this, we consider 1) boosting top-K sequence alignment between the\ndraft model and the target LLM, and 2) relaxing the verification strategy to\nreduce trivial LLM calls. To this end, we propose an alignment framework named\nAtSpeed, which presents the AtSpeed-S optimization objective for top-K\nalignment under the strict top-K verification. Moreover, we introduce a relaxed\nsampling verification strategy that allows high-probability non-top-K drafted\nsequences to be accepted, significantly reducing LLM calls. Correspondingly, we\npropose AtSpeed-R for top-K alignment under this relaxed sampling verification.\nEmpirical results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that AtSpeed\nsignificantly accelerates LLM-based generative recommendation, e.g., near 2x\nspeedup under strict top-K verification and up to 2.5 speedup under relaxed\nsampling verification.

Initial attempts have leveraged the exceptional\ncapabilities of LLMs, such as rich knowledge and strong generalization through\nIn-context Learning, which involves phrasing the recommendation task as\nprompts. Nevertheless, the performance of LLMs in recommendation tasks remains\nsuboptimal due to a substantial disparity between the training tasks for LLMs\nand recommendation tasks and inadequate recommendation data during\npre-training. This paper introduces RLRF4Rec, a novel framework integrating\nReinforcement Learning from Recsys Feedback for Enhanced Recommendation\nReranking(RLRF4Rec) with LLMs to address these challenges. Specifically, We\nfirst have the LLM generate inferred user preferences based on user interaction\nhistory, which is then used to augment traditional ID-based sequence\nrecommendation models. Subsequently, we trained a reward model based on\nknowledge augmentation recommendation models to evaluate the quality of the\nreasoning knowledge from LLM. We then select the best and worst responses from\nthe N samples to construct a dataset for LLM tuning. Finally, we design a\nstructure alignment strategy with Direct Preference Optimization(DPO).

Existing OVD methods mainly rely on the powerful open-vocabulary\nimage-text alignment capability of Vision-Language Pretrained Models (VLM) such\nas CLIP. However, CLIP is trained on image-text pairs and lacks the perceptual\nability for local regions within an image, resulting in the gap between image\nand region representations. Directly using CLIP for OVD causes inaccurate\nregion classification. We find the image-region gap is primarily caused by the\ndeformation of region feature maps during region of interest (RoI) extraction.\nTo mitigate the inaccurate region classification in OVD, we propose a new\nShape-Invariant Adapter named SIA-OVD to bridge the image-region gap in the OVD\ntask. SIA-OVD learns a set of feature adapters for regions with different\nshapes and designs a new adapter allocation mechanism to select the optimal\nadapter for each region. The adapted region representations can align better\nwith text representations learned by CLIP. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat SIA-OVD effectively improves the classification accuracy for regions by\naddressing the gap between images and regions caused by shape deformation.\nSIA-OVD achieves substantial improvements over representative methods on the\nCOCO-OVD benchmark.
